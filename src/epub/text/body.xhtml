<p id="id00012" style="margin-top: 2em">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>
<p id="id00013" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>
<p id="id00014">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 100 billion Etexts given away.</p>
<p id="id00015">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>
<p id="id00026">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>
<p id="id00027">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>
<p id="id00028">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p id="id00029">LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p id="id00030">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the

may have other legal rights.</p>
<p id="id00033">INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost

<p id="id00048" style="margin-top: 2em">The base text for this edition has been provided by Digital Dante,<br/>

a project sponsored by Columbia University's Institute for Learning<br/>

Technologies.  Specific thanks goes to Jennifer Hogan (Project<br/>

<p id="id00049">The Digital Dante Project is a digital 'study space' for Dante studies and
scholarship.  The project is multi-faceted and fluid by nature of the Web.
Digital Dante attempts to organize the information most significant for
students first engaging with Dante and scholars researching Dante.  The
digital of Digital Dante incurs a new challenge to the student, the
scholar, and teacher, perusing the Web: to become proficient in the new
tools, e.g., Search, the Discussion Group, well enough to look beyond the
technology and delve into the content.  For more information and access to
the project, please visit its web site at:
http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/dante/</p>
<p id="id00050">For this Project Gutenberg edition the e-text was rechecked.  The editor
greatly thanks Dian McCarthy for her assistance in proofreading the
Paradiso.  Also deserving praise are Herbert Fann for programming the text
editor "Desktop Tools/Edit" and the late August Dvorak for designing his
keyboard layout.  Please refer to Project Gutenberg's e-text listings for

<h5 id="id00061">INFERNO</h5>
<p id="id00062" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto I</p>
<p id="id00063" style="margin-top: 2em">Midway upon the journey of our life<br/>

  I found myself within a forest dark,<br/>

  For the straightforward pathway had been lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00064">Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br/>

  What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br/>

  Which in the very thought renews the fear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00065">So bitter is it, death is little more;<br/>

  But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br/>

  Speak will I of the other things I saw there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00066">I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br/>

  So full was I of slumber at the moment<br/>

  In which I had abandoned the true way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00067">But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br/>

  At that point where the valley terminated,<br/>

  Which had with consternation pierced my heart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00068">Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br/>

  Vested already with that planet's rays<br/>

  Which leadeth others right by every road.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00069">Then was the fear a little quieted<br/>

  That in my heart's lake had endured throughout<br/>

  The night, which I had passed so piteously.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00070">And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br/>

  Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br/>

  Turns to the water perilous and gazes;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00071">So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br/>

  Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br/>

  Which never yet a living person left.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00072">After my weary body I had rested,<br/>

  The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br/>

  So that the firm foot ever was the lower.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00073">And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br/>

  A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br/>

  Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00074">And never moved she from before my face,<br/>

  Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br/>

  That many times I to return had turned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00075">The time was the beginning of the morning,<br/>

  And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br/>

  That with him were, what time the Love Divine<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00076">At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br/>

  So were to me occasion of good hope,<br/>

  The variegated skin of that wild beast,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00077">The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br/>

  But not so much, that did not give me fear<br/>

  A lion's aspect which appeared to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00078">He seemed as if against me he were coming<br/>

  With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br/>

  So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00079">And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br/>

  Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br/>

  And many folk has caused to live forlorn!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00080">She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br/>

  With the affright that from her aspect came,<br/>

  That I the hope relinquished of the height.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00081">And as he is who willingly acquires,<br/>

  And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br/>

  Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00082">E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br/>

  Which, coming on against me by degrees<br/>

  Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00083">While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br/>

  Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br/>

  Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00084">When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br/>

  "Have pity on me," unto him I cried,<br/>

  "Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00085">He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,<br/>

  And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br/>

  And Mantuans by country both of them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00086">'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,<br/>

  And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br/>

  During the time of false and lying gods.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00087">A poet was I, and I sang that just<br/>

  Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br/>

  After that Ilion the superb was burned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00088">But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br/>

  Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br/>

  Which is the source and cause of every joy?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00089">"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br/>

  Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"<br/>

  I made response to him with bashful forehead.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00090">"O, of the other poets honour and light,<br/>

  Avail me the long study and great love<br/>

  That have impelled me to explore thy volume!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00091">Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br/>

  Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br/>

  The beautiful style that has done honour to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00092">Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br/>

  Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br/>

  For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00093">"Thee it behoves to take another road,"<br/>

  Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br/>

  "If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00094">Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br/>

  Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br/>

  But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00095">And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br/>

  That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br/>

  And after food is hungrier than before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00096">Many the animals with whom she weds,<br/>

  And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br/>

  Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00097">He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br/>

  But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br/>

  'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00098">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br/>

  On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br/>

  Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00099">Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br/>

  Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br/>

  There from whence envy first did let her loose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00100">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br/>

  Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br/>

  And lead thee hence through the eternal place,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00101">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br/>

  Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br/>

  Who cry out each one for the second death;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00102">And thou shalt see those who contented are<br/>

  Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br/>

  Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00103">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br/>

  A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br/>

  With her at my departure I will leave thee;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00104">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br/>

  In that I was rebellious to his law,<br/>

  Wills that through me none come into his city.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00105">He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br/>

  There is his city and his lofty throne;<br/>

  O happy he whom thereto he elects!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00106">And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,<br/>

  By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br/>

  So that I may escape this woe and worse,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00107">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br/>

  That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br/>

  And those thou makest so disconsolate."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00108">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
<p id="id00109" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto II</p>
<p id="id00110" style="margin-top: 2em">Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br/>

  Released the animals that are on earth<br/>

  From their fatigues; and I the only one<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00111">Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br/>

  Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br/>

  Which memory that errs not shall retrace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00112">O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br/>

  O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br/>

  Here thy nobility shall be manifest!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00113">And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,<br/>

  Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br/>

  Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00114">Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br/>

  While yet corruptible, unto the world<br/>

  Immortal went, and was there bodily.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00115">But if the adversary of all evil<br/>

  Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br/>

  That issue would from him, and who, and what,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00116">To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br/>

  For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br/>

  In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00117">The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br/>

  Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br/>

  Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00118">Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br/>

  Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br/>

  Both of his victory and the papal mantle.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00119">Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br/>

  To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br/>

  Which of salvation's way is the beginning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00120">But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br/>

  I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br/>

  Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00121">Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br/>

  I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br/>

  Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00122">And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br/>

  And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br/>

  So that from his design he quite withdraws,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00123">Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br/>

  Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br/>

  Which was so very prompt in the beginning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00124">"If I have well thy language understood,"<br/>

  Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br/>

  "Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00125">Which many times a man encumbers so,<br/>

  It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br/>

  As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00126">That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br/>

  I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br/>

  At the first moment when I grieved for thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00127">Among those was I who are in suspense,<br/>

  And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br/>

  In such wise, I besought her to command me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00128">Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br/>

  And she began to say, gentle and low,<br/>

  With voice angelical, in her own language:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00129">'O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br/>

  Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br/>

  And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00130">A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br/>

  Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br/>

  Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00131">And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br/>

  That I too late have risen to his succour,<br/>

  From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00132">Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br/>

  And with what needful is for his release,<br/>

  Assist him so, that I may be consoled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00133">Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br/>

  I come from there, where I would fain return;<br/>

  Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00134">When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br/>

  Full often will I praise thee unto him.'<br/>

  Then paused she, and thereafter I began:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00135">'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br/>

  The human race exceedeth all contained<br/>

  Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00136">So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br/>

  To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;<br/>

  No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00137">But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br/>

  The here descending down into this centre,<br/>

  From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00138">'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br/>

  Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,<br/>

  'Why I am not afraid to enter here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00139">Of those things only should one be afraid<br/>

  Which have the power of doing others harm;<br/>

  Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00140">God in his mercy such created me<br/>

  That misery of yours attains me not,<br/>

  Nor any flame assails me of this burning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00141">A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br/>

  At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br/>

  So that stern judgment there above is broken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00142">In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br/>

  And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need<br/>

  Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00143">Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br/>

  Hastened away, and came unto the place<br/>

  Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00144">"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,<br/>

  Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br/>

  For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00145">Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br/>

  Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br/>

  Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00146">Never were persons in the world so swift<br/>

  To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br/>

  As I, after such words as these were uttered,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00147">Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br/>

  Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br/>

  Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00148">After she thus had spoken unto me,<br/>

  Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br/>

  Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00149">And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br/>

  I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br/>

  Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00150">What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?<br/>

  Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br/>

  Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00151">Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br/>

  Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br/>

  And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00152">Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br/>

  Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br/>

  Uplift themselves all open on their stems;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00153">Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br/>

  And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br/>

  That I began, like an intrepid person:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00154">"O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br/>

  And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br/>

  The words of truth which she addressed to thee!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00155">Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br/>

  To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br/>

  That to my first intent I have returned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00156">Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br/>

  Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."<br/>

  Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00157">I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
<p id="id00158" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto III</p>
<p id="id00159" style="margin-top: 2em">"Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br/>

  Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br/>

  Through me the way among the people lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00160">Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br/>

  Created me divine Omnipotence,<br/>

  The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00161">Before me there were no created things,<br/>

  Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br/>

  All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00162">These words in sombre colour I beheld<br/>

  Written upon the summit of a gate;<br/>

  Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00163">And he to me, as one experienced:<br/>

  "Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br/>

  All cowardice must needs be here extinct.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00164">We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br/>

  Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br/>

  Who have foregone the good of intellect."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00165">And after he had laid his hand on mine<br/>

  With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br/>

  He led me in among the secret things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00166">There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br/>

  Resounded through the air without a star,<br/>

  Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00167">Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br/>

  Accents of anger, words of agony,<br/>

  And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00168">Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br/>

  For ever in that air for ever black,<br/>

  Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00169">And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br/>

  Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?<br/>

  What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00170">And he to me: "This miserable mode<br/>

  Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br/>

  Who lived withouten infamy or praise.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00171">Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br/>

  Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br/>

  Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00172">The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br/>

  Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br/>

  For glory none the damned would have from them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00173">And I: "O Master, what so grievous is<br/>

  To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"<br/>

  He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00174">These have no longer any hope of death;<br/>

  And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br/>

  They envious are of every other fate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00175">No fame of them the world permits to be;<br/>

  Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br/>

  Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00176">And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br/>

  Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br/>

  That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00177">And after it there came so long a train<br/>

  Of people, that I ne'er would have believed<br/>

  That ever Death so many had undone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00178">When some among them I had recognised,<br/>

  I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br/>

  Who made through cowardice the great refusal.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00179">Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br/>

  That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br/>

  Hateful to God and to his enemies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00180">These miscreants, who never were alive,<br/>

  Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br/>

  By gadflies and by hornets that were there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00181">These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br/>

  Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br/>

  By the disgusting worms was gathered up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00182">And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br/>

  People I saw on a great river's bank;<br/>

  Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00183">That I may know who these are, and what law<br/>

  Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br/>

  As I discern athwart the dusky light."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00184">And he to me: "These things shall all be known<br/>

  To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br/>

  Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00185">Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br/>

  Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br/>

  From speech refrained I till we reached the river.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00186">And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br/>

  An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br/>

  Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00187">Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br/>

  I come to lead you to the other shore,<br/>

  To the eternal shades in heat and frost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00188">And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br/>

  Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"<br/>

  But when he saw that I did not withdraw,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00189">He said: "By other ways, by other ports<br/>

  Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br/>

  A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00190">And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;<br/>

  It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>

  That which is willed; and farther question not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00191">Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br/>

  Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br/>

  Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00192">But all those souls who weary were and naked<br/>

  Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br/>

  As soon as they had heard those cruel words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00193">God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br/>

  The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br/>

  Of their engendering and of their birth!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00194">Thereafter all together they drew back,<br/>

  Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br/>

  Which waiteth every man who fears not God.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00195">Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br/>

  Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br/>

  Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00196">As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br/>

  First one and then another, till the branch<br/>

  Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00197">In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br/>

  Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br/>

  At signals, as a bird unto its lure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00198">So they depart across the dusky wave,<br/>

  And ere upon the other side they land,<br/>

  Again on this side a new troop assembles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00199">"My son," the courteous Master said to me,<br/>

  "All those who perish in the wrath of God<br/>

  Here meet together out of every land;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00200">And ready are they to pass o'er the river,<br/>

  Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br/>

  So that their fear is turned into desire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00201">This way there never passes a good soul;<br/>

  And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br/>

  Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00202">This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br/>

  Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br/>

  The recollection bathes me still with sweat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00203">The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br/>

  And fulminated a vermilion light,<br/>

  Which overmastered in me every sense,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00204">And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
<p id="id00205" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IV</p>
<p id="id00206" style="margin-top: 2em">Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br/>

  A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br/>

  Like to a person who by force is wakened;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00207">And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br/>

  Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br/>

  To recognise the place wherein I was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00208">True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br/>

  Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br/>

  That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00209">Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br/>

  So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br/>

  Nothing whatever I discerned therein.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00210">"Let us descend now into the blind world,"<br/>

  Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br/>

  "I will be first, and thou shalt second be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00211">And I, who of his colour was aware,<br/>

  Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br/>

  Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00212">And he to me: "The anguish of the people<br/>

  Who are below here in my face depicts<br/>

  That pity which for terror thou hast taken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00213">Let us go on, for the long way impels us."<br/>

  Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br/>

  The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00214">There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br/>

  Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br/>

  That tremble made the everlasting air.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00215">And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br/>

  Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br/>

  Of infants and of women and of men.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00216">To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask<br/>

  What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br/>

  Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00217">That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br/>

  'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br/>

  Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00218">And if they were before Christianity,<br/>

  In the right manner they adored not God;<br/>

  And among such as these am I myself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00219">For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br/>

  Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br/>

  That without hope we live on in desire."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00220">Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br/>

  Because some people of much worthiness<br/>

  I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00221">"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"<br/>

  Began I, with desire of being certain<br/>

  Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00222">"Came any one by his own merit hence,<br/>

  Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"<br/>

  And he, who understood my covert speech,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00223">Replied: "I was a novice in this state,<br/>

  When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br/>

  With sign of victory incoronate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00224">Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br/>

  And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br/>

  Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00225">Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br/>

  Israel with his father and his children,<br/>

  And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00226">And others many, and he made them blessed;<br/>

  And thou must know, that earlier than these<br/>

  Never were any human spirits saved."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00227">We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br/>

  But still were passing onward through the forest,<br/>

  The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00228">Not very far as yet our way had gone<br/>

  This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br/>

  That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00229">We were a little distant from it still,<br/>

  But not so far that I in part discerned not<br/>

  That honourable people held that place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00230">"O thou who honourest every art and science,<br/>

  Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br/>

  That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00231">And he to me: "The honourable name,<br/>

  That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br/>

  Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00232">In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br/>

  "All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br/>

  His shade returns again, that was departed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00233">After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br/>

  Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br/>

  Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00234">To say to me began my gracious Master:<br/>

  "Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br/>

  Who comes before the three, even as their lord.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00235">That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br/>

  He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br/>

  The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00236">Because to each of these with me applies<br/>

  The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br/>

  They do me honour, and in that do well."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00237">Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br/>

  Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br/>

  Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00238">When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br/>

  They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br/>

  And on beholding this, my Master smiled;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00239">And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br/>

  In that they made me one of their own band;<br/>

  So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00240">Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br/>

  Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,<br/>

  As was the saying of them where I was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00241">We came unto a noble castle's foot,<br/>

  Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br/>

  Defended round by a fair rivulet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00242">This we passed over even as firm ground;<br/>

  Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br/>

  We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00243">People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br/>

  Of great authority in their countenance;<br/>

  They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00244">Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br/>

  Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br/>

  So that they all of them were visible.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00245">There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br/>

  Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br/>

  Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00246">I saw Electra with companions many,<br/>

  'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br/>

  Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00247">I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br/>

  On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br/>

  Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00248">I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br/>

  Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br/>

  And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00249">When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br/>

  The Master I beheld of those who know,<br/>

  Sit with his philosophic family.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00250">All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br/>

  There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br/>

  Who nearer him before the others stand;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00251">Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br/>

  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br/>

  Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00252">Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br/>

  Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br/>

  Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00253">Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br/>

  Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br/>

  Averroes, who the great Comment made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00254">I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br/>

  Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br/>

  That many times the word comes short of fact.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00255">The sixfold company in two divides;<br/>

  Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br/>

  Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00256">And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>
<p id="id00257" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto V</p>
<p id="id00258" style="margin-top: 2em">Thus I descended out of the first circle<br/>

  Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br/>

  And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00259">There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br/>

  Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br/>

  Judges, and sends according as he girds him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00260">I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br/>

  Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br/>

  And this discriminator of transgressions<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00261">Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br/>

  Girds himself with his tail as many times<br/>

  As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00262">Always before him many of them stand;<br/>

  They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br/>

  They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00263">"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br/>

  Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br/>

  Leaving the practice of so great an office,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00264">"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br/>

  Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."<br/>

  And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00265">Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br/>

  It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>

  That which is willed; and ask no further question."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00266">And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br/>

  Audible unto me; now am I come<br/>

  There where much lamentation strikes upon me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00267">I came into a place mute of all light,<br/>

  Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br/>

  If by opposing winds 't is combated.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00268">The infernal hurricane that never rests<br/>

  Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br/>

  Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00269">When they arrive before the precipice,<br/>

  There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br/>

  There they blaspheme the puissance divine.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00270">I understood that unto such a torment<br/>

  The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br/>

  Who reason subjugate to appetite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00271">And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br/>

  In the cold season in large band and full,<br/>

  So doth that blast the spirits maledict;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00272">It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br/>

  No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br/>

  Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00273">And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br/>

  Making in air a long line of themselves,<br/>

  So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00274">Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br/>

  Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those<br/>

  People, whom the black air so castigates?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00275">"The first of those, of whom intelligence<br/>

  Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,<br/>

  "The empress was of many languages.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00276">To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br/>

  That lustful she made licit in her law,<br/>

  To remove the blame to which she had been led.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00277">She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br/>

  That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br/>

  She held the land which now the Sultan rules.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00278">The next is she who killed herself for love,<br/>

  And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br/>

  Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00279">Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br/>

  Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br/>

  Who at the last hour combated with Love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00280">Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br/>

  Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br/>

  Whom Love had separated from our life.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00281">After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br/>

  Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br/>

  Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00282">And I began: "O Poet, willingly<br/>

  Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br/>

  And seem upon the wind to be so light."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00283">And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be<br/>

  Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br/>

  By love which leadeth them, and they will come."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00284">Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br/>

  My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!<br/>

  Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00285">As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br/>

  With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br/>

  Fly through the air by their volition borne,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00286">So came they from the band where Dido is,<br/>

  Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br/>

  So strong was the affectionate appeal.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00287">"O living creature gracious and benignant,<br/>

  Who visiting goest through the purple air<br/>

  Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00288">If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br/>

  We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br/>

  Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00289">Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br/>

  That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br/>

  While silent is the wind, as it is now.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00290">Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br/>

  Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br/>

  To rest in peace with all his retinue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00291">Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br/>

  Seized this man for the person beautiful<br/>

  That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00292">Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br/>

  Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br/>

  That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00293">Love has conducted us unto one death;<br/>

  Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"<br/>

  These words were borne along from them to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00294">As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br/>

  I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br/>

  Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00295">When I made answer, I began: "Alas!<br/>

  How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br/>

  Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00296">Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br/>

  And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,<br/>

  Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00297">But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br/>

  By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br/>

  That you should know your dubious desires?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00298">And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow<br/>

  Than to be mindful of the happy time<br/>

  In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00299">But, if to recognise the earliest root<br/>

  Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br/>

  I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00300">One day we reading were for our delight<br/>

  Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br/>

  Alone we were and without any fear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00301">Full many a time our eyes together drew<br/>

  That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br/>

  But one point only was it that o'ercame us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00302">When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br/>

  Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br/>

  This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00303">Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br/>

  Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br/>

  That day no farther did we read therein."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00304">And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br/>

  The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br/>

  I swooned away as if I had been dying,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00305">And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>
<p id="id00306" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VI</p>
<p id="id00307" style="margin-top: 2em">At the return of consciousness, that closed<br/>

  Before the pity of those two relations,<br/>

  Which utterly with sadness had confused me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00308">New torments I behold, and new tormented<br/>

  Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br/>

  And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00309">In the third circle am I of the rain<br/>

  Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br/>

  Its law and quality are never new.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00310">Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br/>

  Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br/>

  Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00311">Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br/>

  With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br/>

  Over the people that are there submerged.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00312">Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br/>

  And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br/>

  He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00313">Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br/>

  One side they make a shelter for the other;<br/>

  Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00314">When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br/>

   His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br/>

   Not a limb had he that was motionless.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00315">And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br/>

  Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br/>

  He threw it into those rapacious gullets.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00316">Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br/>

  And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br/>

  For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00317">The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br/>

  Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br/>

  Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00318">We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br/>

  The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br/>

  Upon their vanity that person seems.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00319">They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br/>

  Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br/>

  As he beheld us passing on before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00320">"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"<br/>

  He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;<br/>

  Thyself wast made before I was unmade."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00321">And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast<br/>

  Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br/>

  So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00322">But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br/>

  A place art put, and in such punishment,<br/>

  If some are greater, none is so displeasing."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00323">And he to me: "Thy city, which is full<br/>

  Of envy so that now the sack runs over,<br/>

  Held me within it in the life serene.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00324">You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<br/>

  For the pernicious sin of gluttony<br/>

  I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00325">And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br/>

  For all these suffer the like penalty<br/>

  For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00326">I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br/>

  Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br/>

  But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00327">The citizens of the divided city;<br/>

  If any there be just; and the occasion<br/>

  Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00328">And he to me: "They, after long contention,<br/>

  Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br/>

  Will drive the other out with much offence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00329">Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br/>

  Within three suns, and rise again the other<br/>

  By force of him who now is on the coast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00330">High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br/>

  Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br/>

  Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00331">The just are two, and are not understood there;<br/>

  Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br/>

  Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00332">Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br/>

  And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,<br/>

  And make a gift to me of further speech.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00333">Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br/>

  Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br/>

  And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00334">Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br/>

  For great desire constraineth me to learn<br/>

  If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00335">And he: "They are among the blacker souls;<br/>

  A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br/>

  If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00336">But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br/>

  I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br/>

  No more I tell thee and no more I answer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00337">Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br/>

  Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br/>

  He fell therewith prone like the other blind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00338">And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more<br/>

  This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br/>

  When shall approach the hostile Potentate,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00339">Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br/>

  Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br/>

  Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00340">So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture<br/>

  Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br/>

  Touching a little on the future life.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00341">Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,<br/>

  Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br/>

  Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00342">And he to me: "Return unto thy science,<br/>

  Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br/>

  The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00343">Albeit that this people maledict<br/>

  To true perfection never can attain,<br/>

  Hereafter more than now they look to be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00344">Round in a circle by that road we went,<br/>

  Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br/>

  We came unto the point where the descent is;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00345">There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>
<p id="id00346" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VII</p>
<p id="id00347" style="margin-top: 2em">"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"<br/>

  Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br/>

  And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00348">Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear<br/>

  Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br/>

  Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00349">Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br/>

  And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br/>

  Consume within thyself with thine own rage.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00350">Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br/>

  Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br/>

  Vengeance upon the proud adultery."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00351">Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br/>

  Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br/>

  So fell the cruel monster to the earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00352">Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br/>

  Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br/>

  Which all the woe of the universe insacks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00353">Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br/>

  New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br/>

  And why doth our transgression waste us so?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00354">As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br/>

  That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br/>

  So here the folk must dance their roundelay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00355">Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br/>

  On one side and the other, with great howls,<br/>

  Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00356">They clashed together, and then at that point<br/>

  Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br/>

  Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00357">Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br/>

  On either hand unto the opposite point,<br/>

  Shouting their shameful metre evermore.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00358">Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br/>

  Through his half-circle to another joust;<br/>

  And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00359">Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me<br/>

  What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br/>

  These shaven crowns upon the left of us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00360">And he to me: "All of them were asquint<br/>

  In intellect in the first life, so much<br/>

  That there with measure they no spending made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00361">Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br/>

  Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,<br/>

  Where sunders them the opposite defect.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00362">Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br/>

  Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br/>

  In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00363">And I: "My Master, among such as these<br/>

  I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br/>

  Who were infected with these maladies."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00364">And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;<br/>

  The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br/>

  Now makes them unto all discernment dim.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00365">Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br/>

  These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br/>

  With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00366">Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br/>

  Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br/>

  Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00367">Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br/>

  Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br/>

  For which the human race each other buffet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00368">For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br/>

  Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br/>

  Could never make a single one repose."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00369">"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also<br/>

  What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br/>

  That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00370">And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,<br/>

  What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br/>

  Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00371">He whose omniscience everything transcends<br/>

  The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br/>

  That every part to every part may shine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00372">Distributing the light in equal measure;<br/>

  He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br/>

  Ordained a general ministress and guide,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00373">That she might change at times the empty treasures<br/>

  From race to race, from one blood to another,<br/>

  Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00374">Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br/>

  Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br/>

  Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00375">Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br/>

  She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br/>

  Her governance, as theirs the other gods.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00376">Her permutations have not any truce;<br/>

  Necessity makes her precipitate,<br/>

  So often cometh who his turn obtains.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00377">And this is she who is so crucified<br/>

  Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br/>

  Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00378">But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br/>

  Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br/>

  She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00379">Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br/>

  Already sinks each star that was ascending<br/>

  When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00380">We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br/>

  Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br/>

  Along a gully that runs out of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00381">The water was more sombre far than perse;<br/>

  And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br/>

  Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00382">A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br/>

  This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br/>

  Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00383">And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br/>

  Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br/>

  All of them naked and with angry look.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00384">They smote each other not alone with hands,<br/>

  But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br/>

  Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00385">Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest<br/>

  The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br/>

  And likewise I would have thee know for certain<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00386">Beneath the water people are who sigh<br/>

  And make this water bubble at the surface,<br/>

  As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00387">Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were<br/>

  In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br/>

  Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00388">Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'<br/>

  This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br/>

  For with unbroken words they cannot say it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00389">Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br/>

  A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br/>

  With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00390">Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>
<p id="id00391" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VIII</p>
<p id="id00392" style="margin-top: 2em">I say, continuing, that long before<br/>

  We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br/>

  Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00393">By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br/>

  And from afar another answer them,<br/>

  So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00394">And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br/>

  I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br/>

  That other fire? and who are they that made it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00395">And he to me: "Across the turbid waves<br/>

  What is expected thou canst now discern,<br/>

  If reek of the morass conceal it not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00396">Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br/>

  That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br/>

  As I beheld a very little boat<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00397">Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,<br/>

  Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br/>

  Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00398">"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br/>

  For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us<br/>

  Longer than in the passing of the slough."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00399">As he who listens to some great deceit<br/>

  That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br/>

  Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00400">My Guide descended down into the boat,<br/>

  And then he made me enter after him,<br/>

  And only when I entered seemed it laden.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00401">Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br/>

  The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br/>

  More of the water than 'tis wont with others.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00402">While we were running through the dead canal,<br/>

  Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br/>

  And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00403">And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;<br/>

  But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"<br/>

  "Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00404">And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,<br/>

  Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br/>

  For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00405">Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br/>

  Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br/>

  Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00406">Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br/>

  He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,<br/>

  Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00407">That was an arrogant person in the world;<br/>

  Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br/>

  So likewise here his shade is furious.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00408">How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br/>

  Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br/>

  Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00409">And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,<br/>

  If I could see him soused into this broth,<br/>

  Before we issue forth out of the lake."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00410">And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore<br/>

  Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br/>

  Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00411">A little after that, I saw such havoc<br/>

  Made of him by the people of the mire,<br/>

  That still I praise and thank my God for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00412">They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"<br/>

  And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br/>

  Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00413">We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br/>

  But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br/>

  Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00414">And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,<br/>

  The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br/>

  With the grave citizens, with the great throng."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00415">And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br/>

  Within there in the valley I discern<br/>

  Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00416">They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal<br/>

  That kindles them within makes them look red,<br/>

  As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00417">Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br/>

  That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br/>

  The walls appeared to me to be of iron.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00418">Not without making first a circuit wide,<br/>

  We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br/>

  Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00419">More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br/>

  Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br/>

  Were saying, "Who is this that without death<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00420">Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"<br/>

  And my sagacious Master made a sign<br/>

  Of wishing secretly to speak with them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00421">A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br/>

  And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone<br/>

  Who has so boldly entered these dominions.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00422">Let him return alone by his mad road;<br/>

  Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br/>

  Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00423">Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br/>

  At utterance of the accursed words;<br/>

  For never to return here I believed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00424">"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br/>

  Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br/>

  From imminent peril that before me stood,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00425">Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;<br/>

  And if the going farther be denied us,<br/>

  Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00426">And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage<br/>

  None can take from us, it by Such is given.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00427">But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br/>

  Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br/>

  For in this nether world I will not leave thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00428">So onward goes and there abandons me<br/>

  My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br/>

  For No and Yes within my head contend.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00429">I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br/>

  But with them there he did not linger long,<br/>

  Ere each within in rivalry ran back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00430">They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br/>

  On my Lord's breast, who had remained without<br/>

  And turned to me with footsteps far between.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00431">His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br/>

  Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br/>

  "Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00432">And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,<br/>

  Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br/>

  Whatever for defence within be planned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00433">This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br/>

  For once they used it at less secret gate,<br/>

  Which finds itself without a fastening still.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00434">O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br/>

  And now this side of it descends the steep,<br/>

  Passing across the circles without escort,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00435">One by whose means the city shall be opened."</p>
<p id="id00436" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IX</p>
<p id="id00437" style="margin-top: 2em">That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br/>

  Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br/>

  Sooner repressed within him his new colour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00438">He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br/>

  Because the eye could not conduct him far<br/>

  Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00439">"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"<br/>

  Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br/>

  O how I long that some one here arrive!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00440">Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br/>

  He covered up with what came afterward,<br/>

  That they were words quite different from the first;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00441">But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br/>

  Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br/>

  Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00442">"Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br/>

  Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,<br/>

  Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00443">This question put I; and he answered me:<br/>

  "Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br/>

  Maketh the journey upon which I go.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00444">True is it, once before I here below<br/>

  Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br/>

  Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00445">Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br/>

  Before within that wall she made me enter,<br/>

  To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00446">That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br/>

  And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br/>

  Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00447">This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br/>

  Encompasses about the city dolent,<br/>

  Where now we cannot enter without anger."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00448">And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br/>

  Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br/>

  Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00449">Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br/>

  The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br/>

  Who had the limbs of women and their mien,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00450">And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br/>

  Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br/>

  Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00451">And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br/>

  Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00452">This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br/>

  She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br/>

  Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00453">Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br/>

  They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br/>

  That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00454">"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"<br/>

  All shouted looking down; "in evil hour<br/>

  Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00455">"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br/>

  For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br/>

  No more returning upward would there be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00456">Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br/>

  Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br/>

  So far as not to blind me with his own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00457">O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br/>

  Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br/>

  Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00458">And now there came across the turbid waves<br/>

  The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br/>

  Because of which both of the margins trembled;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00459">Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br/>

  Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br/>

  That smites the forest, and, without restraint,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00460">The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br/>

  Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br/>

  And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00461">Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve<br/>

  Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br/>

  There yonder where that smoke is most intense."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00462">Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br/>

  Across the water scatter all abroad,<br/>

  Until each one is huddled in the earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00463">More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br/>

  Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br/>

  Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00464">From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br/>

  Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br/>

  And only with that anguish seemed he weary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00465">Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br/>

  And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br/>

  That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00466">Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br/>

  He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br/>

  He opened it, for there was no resistance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00467">"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"<br/>

  Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br/>

  "Whence is this arrogance within you couched?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00468">Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br/>

  From which the end can never be cut off,<br/>

  And which has many times increased your pain?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00469">What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br/>

  Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br/>

  For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00470">Then he returned along the miry road,<br/>

  And spake no word to us, but had the look<br/>

  Of one whom other care constrains and goads<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00471">Than that of him who in his presence is;<br/>

  And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,<br/>

  After those holy words all confident.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00472">Within we entered without any contest;<br/>

  And I, who inclination had to see<br/>

  What the condition such a fortress holds,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00473">Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br/>

  And see on every hand an ample plain,<br/>

  Full of distress and torment terrible.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00474">Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br/>

  Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br/>

  That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00475">The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br/>

  So likewise did they there on every side,<br/>

  Saving that there the manner was more bitter;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00476">For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br/>

  By which they so intensely heated were,<br/>

  That iron more so asks not any art.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00477">All of their coverings uplifted were,<br/>

  And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br/>

  Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00478">And I: "My Master, what are all those people<br/>

  Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br/>

  Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00479">And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,<br/>

  With their disciples of all sects, and much<br/>

  More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00480">Here like together with its like is buried;<br/>

  And more and less the monuments are heated."<br/>

  And when he to the right had turned, we passed<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00481">Between the torments and high parapets.</p>
<p id="id00482" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto X</p>
<p id="id00483" style="margin-top: 2em">Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br/>

  Between the torments and the city wall,<br/>

  My Master, and I follow at his back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00484">"O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br/>

  Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,<br/>

  Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00485">The people who are lying in these tombs,<br/>

  Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br/>

  The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00486">And he to me: "They all will be closed up<br/>

  When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br/>

  Here with the bodies they have left above.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00487">Their cemetery have upon this side<br/>

  With Epicurus all his followers,<br/>

  Who with the body mortal make the soul;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00488">But in the question thou dost put to me,<br/>

  Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br/>

  And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00489">And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br/>

  From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br/>

  Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00490">"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br/>

  Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br/>

  Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00491">Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br/>

  A native of that noble fatherland,<br/>

  To which perhaps I too molestful was."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00492">Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br/>

  From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br/>

  Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00493">And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?<br/>

  Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br/>

  From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00494">I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br/>

  And he uprose erect with breast and front<br/>

  E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00495">And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br/>

  Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br/>

  Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00496">As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br/>

  Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br/>

  Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00497">I, who desirous of obeying was,<br/>

  Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br/>

  Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00498">Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been<br/>

  To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br/>

  So that two several times I scattered them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00499">"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"<br/>

  I answered him, "the first time and the second;<br/>

  But yours have not acquired that art aright."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00500">Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br/>

  Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br/>

  I think that he had risen on his knees.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00501">Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br/>

  He had to see if some one else were with me,<br/>

  But after his suspicion was all spent,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00502">Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind<br/>

  Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br/>

  Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00503">And I to him: "I come not of myself;<br/>

  He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br/>

  Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00504">His language and the mode of punishment<br/>

  Already unto me had read his name;<br/>

  On that account my answer was so full.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00505">Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How<br/>

  Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?<br/>

  Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00506">When he became aware of some delay,<br/>

  Which I before my answer made, supine<br/>

  He fell again, and forth appeared no more.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00507">But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br/>

  I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br/>

  Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00508">"And if," continuing his first discourse,<br/>

  "They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,<br/>

  That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00509">But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br/>

  The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br/>

  Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00510">And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br/>

  Say why that people is so pitiless<br/>

  Against my race in each one of its laws?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00511">Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage<br/>

  Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br/>

  Such orisons in our temple to be made."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00512">After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br/>

  "There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely<br/>

  Without a cause had with the others moved.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00513">But there I was alone, where every one<br/>

  Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br/>

  He who defended her with open face."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00514">"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"<br/>

  I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,<br/>

  Which has entangled my conceptions here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00515">It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br/>

  Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,<br/>

  And in the present have another mode."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00516">"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br/>

  The things," he said, "that distant are from us;<br/>

  So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00517">When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br/>

  Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br/>

  Not anything know we of your human state.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00518">Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br/>

  Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br/>

  The portal of the future shall be closed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00519">Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br/>

  Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br/>

  That still his son is with the living joined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00520">And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br/>

  Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br/>

  Already of the error you have solved me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00521">And now my Master was recalling me,<br/>

  Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br/>

  That he would tell me who was with him there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00522">He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;<br/>

  Within here is the second Frederick,<br/>

  And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00523">Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br/>

  The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br/>

  Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00524">He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br/>

  He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"<br/>

  And I in his inquiry satisfied him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00525">"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br/>

  Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,<br/>

  "And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00526">"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br/>

  Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br/>

  From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00527">Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br/>

  We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br/>

  Along a path that strikes into a valley,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00528">Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>
<p id="id00529" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XI</p>
<p id="id00530" style="margin-top: 2em">Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br/>

  Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br/>

  We came upon a still more cruel throng;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00531">And there, by reason of the horrible<br/>

  Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br/>

  We drew ourselves aside behind the cover<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00532">Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br/>

  Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,<br/>

  Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00533">"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br/>

  So that the sense be first a little used<br/>

  To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00534">The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br/>

  "Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br/>

  Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00535">My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"<br/>

  Began he then to say, "are three small circles,<br/>

  From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00536">They all are full of spirits maledict;<br/>

  But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br/>

  Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00537">Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br/>

  Injury is the end; and all such end<br/>

  Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00538">But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br/>

  More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br/>

  The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00539">All the first circle of the Violent is;<br/>

  But since force may be used against three persons,<br/>

  In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00540">To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br/>

  Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br/>

  As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00541">A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br/>

  Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br/>

  Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00542">Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br/>

  Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br/>

  Tormenteth all in companies diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00543">Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br/>

  And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br/>

  Round must perforce without avail repent<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00544">Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br/>

  Who games, and dissipates his property,<br/>

  And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00545">Violence can be done the Deity,<br/>

  In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br/>

  And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00546">And for this reason doth the smallest round<br/>

  Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br/>

  And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00547">Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br/>

  A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br/>

  And him who doth no confidence imburse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00548">This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br/>

  Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br/>

  Wherefore within the second circle nestle<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00549">Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br/>

  Falsification, theft, and simony,<br/>

  Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00550">By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br/>

  Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br/>

  From which there is a special faith engendered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00551">Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br/>

  Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br/>

  Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00552">And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds<br/>

  Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br/>

  This cavern and the people who possess it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00553">But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br/>

  Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br/>

  And who encounter with such bitter tongues,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00554">Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br/>

  Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br/>

  And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00555">And unto me he said: "Why wanders so<br/>

  Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br/>

  Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00556">Hast thou no recollection of those words<br/>

  With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br/>

  The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00557">Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br/>

  Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br/>

  Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00558">If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br/>

  And to thy mind recallest who they are<br/>

  That up outside are undergoing penance,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00559">Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br/>

  They separated are, and why less wroth<br/>

  Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00560">"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br/>

  Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br/>

  That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00561">Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,<br/>

  "There where thou sayest that usury offends<br/>

  Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00562">"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,<br/>

  Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br/>

  After what manner Nature takes her course<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00563">From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br/>

  And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br/>

  After not many pages shalt thou find,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00564">That this your art as far as possible<br/>

  Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br/>

  So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00565">From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br/>

  Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br/>

  Mankind to gain their life and to advance;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00566">And since the usurer takes another way,<br/>

  Nature herself and in her follower<br/>

  Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00567">But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br/>

  For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br/>

  And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00568">And far beyond there we descend the crag."</p>
<p id="id00569" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XII</p>
<p id="id00570" style="margin-top: 2em">The place where to descend the bank we came<br/>

  Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br/>

  Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00571">Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br/>

  Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<br/>

  Either by earthquake or by failing stay,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00572">For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,<br/>

  Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br/>

  Some path 'twould give to him who was above;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00573">Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br/>

  And on the border of the broken chasm<br/>

  The infamy of Crete was stretched along,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00574">Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br/>

  And when he us beheld, he bit himself,<br/>

  Even as one whom anger racks within.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00575">My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure<br/>

  Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br/>

  Who in the world above brought death to thee?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00576">Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br/>

  Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br/>

  In order to behold your punishments."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00577">As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br/>

<p id="id00578">The Minotaur beheld I do the like;<br/>

  And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;<br/>

  While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00579">Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge<br/>

  Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00580">Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking<br/>

  Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded<br/>

  By that brute anger which just now I quenched.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00581">Now will I have thee know, the other time<br/>

  I here descended to the nether Hell,<br/>

  This precipice had not yet fallen down.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00582">But truly, if I well discern, a little<br/>

  Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br/>

  Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00583">Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br/>

  Trembled so, that I thought the Universe<br/>

  Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00584">The world ofttimes converted into chaos;<br/>

  And at that moment this primeval crag<br/>

  Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00585">But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near<br/>

  The river of blood, within which boiling is<br/>

  Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00586">O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,<br/>

  That spurs us onward so in our short life,<br/>

  And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00587">I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,<br/>

  As one which all the plain encompasses,<br/>

  Conformable to what my Guide had said.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00588">And between this and the embankment's foot<br/>

  Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<br/>

  As in the world they used the chase to follow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00589">Beholding us descend, each one stood still,<br/>

  And from the squadron three detached themselves,<br/>

  With bows and arrows in advance selected;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00590">And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment<br/>

  Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?<br/>

  Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00591">My Master said: "Our answer will we make<br/>

  To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,<br/>

  That will of thine was evermore so hasty."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00592">Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,<br/>

  Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br/>

  And for himself, himself did vengeance take.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00593">And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br/>

  Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br/>

  That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00594">Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br/>

  Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br/>

  Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00595">Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br/>

  Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br/>

  Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00596">After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br/>

  He said to his companions: "Are you ware<br/>

  That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00597">Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."<br/>

  And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br/>

  Where the two natures are together joined,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00598">Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br/>

  Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br/>

  Necessity, and not delight, impels us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00599">Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br/>

  Who unto me committed this new office;<br/>

  No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00600">But by that virtue through which I am moving<br/>

  My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br/>

  Give us some one of thine, to be with us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00601">And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br/>

  And who may carry this one on his back;<br/>

  For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00602">Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br/>

  And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,<br/>

  And warn aside, if other band may meet you."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00603">We with our faithful escort onward moved<br/>

  Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br/>

  Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00604">People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br/>

  And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,<br/>

  Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00605">Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br/>

  Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br/>

  Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00606">That forehead there which has the hair so black<br/>

  Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br/>

  Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00607">Up in the world was by his stepson slain."<br/>

  Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br/>

  "Now he be first to thee, and second I."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00608">A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br/>

  Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br/>

  Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00609">A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br/>

  Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom<br/>

  The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00610">Then people saw I, who from out the river<br/>

  Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br/>

  And many among these I recognised.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00611">Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br/>

  That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br/>

  And there across the moat our passage was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00612">"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br/>

  The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"<br/>

  The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00613">That on this other more and more declines<br/>

  Its bed, until it reunites itself<br/>

  Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00614">Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br/>

  That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br/>

  And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00615">The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br/>

  In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br/>

  Who made upon the highways so much war."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00616">Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>
<p id="id00617" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIII</p>
<p id="id00618" style="margin-top: 2em">Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br/>

  When we had put ourselves within a wood,<br/>

  That was not marked by any path whatever.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00619">Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br/>

  Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br/>

  Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00620">Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br/>

  Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br/>

  'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00621">There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,<br/>

  Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,<br/>

  With sad announcement of impending doom;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00622">Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,<br/>

  And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;<br/>

  They make laments upon the wondrous trees.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00623">And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,<br/>

  Know that thou art within the second round,"<br/>

  Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00624">Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;<br/>

  Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see<br/>

  Things that will credence give unto my speech."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00625">I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,<br/>

  And person none beheld I who might make them,<br/>

  Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00626">I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br/>

  So many voices issued through those trunks<br/>

  From people who concealed themselves from us;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00627">Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off<br/>

  Some little spray from any of these trees,<br/>

  The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00628">Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br/>

  And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br/>

  And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00629">After it had become embrowned with blood,<br/>

  It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?<br/>

  Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00630">Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br/>

  Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br/>

  Even if the souls of serpents we had been."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00631">As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br/>

  At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br/>

  And hisses with the wind that is escaping;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00632">So from that splinter issued forth together<br/>

  Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br/>

  Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00633">"Had he been able sooner to believe,"<br/>

  My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,<br/>

  What only in my verses he has seen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00634">Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br/>

  Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br/>

  To put him to an act which grieveth me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00635">But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br/>

  Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br/>

  Up in the world, to which he can return."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00636">And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,<br/>

  I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br/>

  That I a little to discourse am tempted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00637">I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br/>

  Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro<br/>

  So softly in unlocking and in locking,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00638">That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br/>

  Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br/>

  So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00639">The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br/>

  Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br/>

  Death universal and the vice of courts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00640">Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br/>

  And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br/>

  That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00641">My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br/>

  Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br/>

  Made me unjust against myself, the just.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00642">I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br/>

  Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br/>

  Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00643">And to the world if one of you return,<br/>

  Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br/>

  Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00644">Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"<br/>

  The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,<br/>

  But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00645">Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire<br/>

  Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;<br/>

  For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00646">Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man<br/>

  Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br/>

  Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00647">To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br/>

  Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br/>

  If any from such members e'er is freed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00648">Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br/>

  The wind was into such a voice converted:<br/>

  "With brevity shall be replied to you.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00649">When the exasperated soul abandons<br/>

  The body whence it rent itself away,<br/>

  Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00650">It falls into the forest, and no part<br/>

  Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br/>

  There like a grain of spelt it germinates.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00651">It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br/>

  The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br/>

  Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00652">Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br/>

  But not that any one may them revest,<br/>

  For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00653">Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br/>

  Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br/>

  Each to the thorn of his molested shade."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00654">We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br/>

  Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br/>

  When by a tumult we were overtaken,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00655">In the same way as he is who perceives<br/>

  The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br/>

  Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00656">And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br/>

  Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br/>

  That of the forest, every fan they broke.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00657">He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"<br/>

  And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br/>

  Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00658">Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"<br/>

  And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br/>

  He grouped himself together with a bush.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00659">Behind them was the forest full of black<br/>

  She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br/>

  As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00660">On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br/>

  And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br/>

  Thereafter bore away those aching members.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00661">Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br/>

  And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br/>

  Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00662">"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,<br/>

  What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br/>

  What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00663">When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br/>

  He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br/>

  Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00664">And he to us: "O souls, that hither come<br/>

  To look upon the shameful massacre<br/>

  That has so rent away from me my leaves,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00665">Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br/>

  I of that city was which to the Baptist<br/>

  Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00666">Forever with his art will make it sad.<br/>

  And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br/>

  Some glimpses of him are remaining still,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00667">Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br/>

  Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br/>

  In vain had caused their labour to be done.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00668">Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</p>
<p id="id00669" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIV</p>
<p id="id00670" style="margin-top: 2em">Because the charity of my native place<br/>

  Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br/>

  And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00671">Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br/>

  The second round is from the third, and where<br/>

  A horrible form of Justice is beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00672">Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br/>

  I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br/>

  Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00673">The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br/>

  All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br/>

  There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00674">The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br/>

  Not of another fashion made than that<br/>

  Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00675">Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br/>

  By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br/>

  That which was manifest unto mine eyes!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00676">Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br/>

  Who all were weeping very miserably,<br/>

  And over them seemed set a law diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00677">Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br/>

  And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br/>

  And others went about continually.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00678">Those who were going round were far the more,<br/>

  And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br/>

  But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00679">O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br/>

  Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br/>

  As of the snow on Alp without a wind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00680">As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br/>

  Of India, beheld upon his host<br/>

  Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00681">Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br/>

  To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br/>

  Better extinguished was while it was single;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00682">Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br/>

  Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br/>

  Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00683">Without repose forever was the dance<br/>

  Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br/>

  Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00684">"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest<br/>

  All things except the demons dire, that issued<br/>

  Against us at the entrance of the gate,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00685">Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br/>

  The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br/>

  So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00686">And he himself, who had become aware<br/>

  That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br/>

  Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00687">If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br/>

  He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br/>

  Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00688">And if he wearied out by turns the others<br/>

  In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br/>

  Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00689">Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br/>

  And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br/>

  He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00690">Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br/>

  That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br/>

  "O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00691">Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br/>

  Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br/>

  Would be unto thy fury pain complete."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00692">Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br/>

  Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he<br/>

  Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00693">God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br/>

  But, as I said to him, his own despites<br/>

  Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00694">Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br/>

  As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br/>

  But always keep them close unto the wood."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00695">Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br/>

  Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br/>

  Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00696">As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br/>

  The sinful women later share among them,<br/>

  So downward through the sand it went its way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00697">The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br/>

  Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br/>

  Whence I perceived that there the passage was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00698">"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br/>

  Since we have entered in within the gate<br/>

  Whose threshold unto no one is denied,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00699">Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br/>

  So notable as is the present river,<br/>

  Which all the little flames above it quenches."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00700">These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br/>

  That he would give me largess of the food,<br/>

  For which he had given me largess of desire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00701">"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"<br/>

  Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,<br/>

  Under whose king the world of old was chaste.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00702">There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br/>

  With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br/>

  Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00703">Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br/>

  Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br/>

  Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00704">A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br/>

  Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,<br/>

  And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00705">His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br/>

  And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br/>

  Then he is brass as far down as the fork.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00706">From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br/>

  Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br/>

  And more he stands on that than on the other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00707">Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br/>

  Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br/>

  Which gathered together perforate that cavern.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00708">From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br/>

  Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br/>

  Then downward go along this narrow sluice<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00709">Unto that point where is no more descending.<br/>

  They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br/>

  Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00710">And I to him: "If so the present runnel<br/>

  Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br/>

  Why only on this verge appears it to us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00711">And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,<br/>

  And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br/>

  Still to the left descending to the bottom,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00712">Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br/>

  Therefore if something new appear to us,<br/>

  It should not bring amazement to thy face."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00713">And I again: "Master, where shall be found<br/>

  Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,<br/>

  And sayest the other of this rain is made?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00714">"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"<br/>

  Replied he; "but the boiling of the red<br/>

  Water might well solve one of them thou makest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00715">Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br/>

  There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br/>

  When sin repented of has been removed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00716">Then said he: "It is time now to abandon<br/>

  The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br/>

  A way the margins make that are not burning,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00717">And over them all vapours are extinguished."</p>
<p id="id00718" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XV</p>
<p id="id00719" style="margin-top: 2em">Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,<br/>

  And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,<br/>

  From fire it saves the water and the dikes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00720">Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br/>

  Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,<br/>

  Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00721">And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br/>

  To guard their villas and their villages,<br/>

  Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00722">In such similitude had those been made,<br/>

  Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br/>

  Whoever he might be, the master made them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00723">Now were we from the forest so remote,<br/>

  I could not have discovered where it was,<br/>

  Even if backward I had turned myself,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00724">When we a company of souls encountered,<br/>

  Who came beside the dike, and every one<br/>

  Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00725">To eye each other under a new moon,<br/>

  And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br/>

  As an old tailor at the needle's eye.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00726">Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br/>

  By some one I was recognised, who seized<br/>

  My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00727">And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br/>

  On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br/>

  That the scorched countenance prevented not<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00728">His recognition by my intellect;<br/>

  And bowing down my face unto his own,<br/>

  I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00729">And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,<br/>

  If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br/>

  Backward return and let the trail go on."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00730">I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;<br/>

  And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br/>

  I will, if he please, for I go with him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00731">"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd<br/>

  A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br/>

  Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00732">Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br/>

  And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br/>

  Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00733">I did not dare to go down from the road<br/>

  Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br/>

  I held as one who goeth reverently.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00734">And he began: "What fortune or what fate<br/>

  Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br/>

  And who is this that showeth thee the way?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00735">"Up there above us in the life serene,"<br/>

  I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,<br/>

  Or ever yet my age had been completed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00736">But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br/>

  This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br/>

  And homeward leadeth me along this road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00737">And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,<br/>

  Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br/>

  If well I judged in the life beautiful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00738">And if I had not died so prematurely,<br/>

  Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br/>

  I would have given thee comfort in the work.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00739">But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br/>

  Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br/>

  And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00740">Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br/>

  And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br/>

  It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00741">Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br/>

  A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br/>

  Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00742">Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br/>

  One party and the other shall be hungry<br/>

  For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00743">Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br/>

  Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br/>

  If any still upon their dunghill rise,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00744">In which may yet revive the consecrated<br/>

  Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br/>

  The nest of such great malice it became."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00745">"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"<br/>

  Replied I to him, "not yet would you be<br/>

  In banishment from human nature placed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00746">For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br/>

  My heart the dear and good paternal image<br/>

  Of you, when in the world from hour to hour<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00747">You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br/>

  And how much I am grateful, while I live<br/>

  Behoves that in my language be discerned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00748">What you narrate of my career I write,<br/>

  And keep it to be glossed with other text<br/>

  By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00749">This much will I have manifest to you;<br/>

  Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br/>

  For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00750">Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br/>

  Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br/>

  As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00751">My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br/>

  Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br/>

  Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00752">Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br/>

  With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br/>

  His most known and most eminent companions.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00753">And he to me: "To know of some is well;<br/>

  Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br/>

  For short would be the time for so much speech.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00754">Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br/>

  And men of letters great and of great fame,<br/>

  In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00755">Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br/>

  And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br/>

  If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00756">That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br/>

  From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br/>

  Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00757">More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br/>

  Can be no longer; for that I behold<br/>

  New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00758">A people comes with whom I may not be;<br/>

  Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br/>

  In which I still live, and no more I ask."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00759">Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br/>

  Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br/>

  Across the plain; and seemed to be among them<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00760">The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>
<p id="id00761" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVI</p>
<p id="id00762" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br/>

  Of water falling into the next round,<br/>

  Like to that humming which the beehives make,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00763">When shadows three together started forth,<br/>

  Running, from out a company that passed<br/>

  Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00764">Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br/>

  "Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br/>

  To be some one of our depraved city."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00765">Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br/>

  Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!<br/>

  It pains me still but to remember it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00766">Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br/>

  He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"<br/>

  He said; "to these we should be courteous.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00767">And if it were not for the fire that darts<br/>

  The nature of this region, I should say<br/>

  That haste were more becoming thee than them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00768">As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br/>

  The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br/>

  Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00769">As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br/>

  Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br/>

  Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00770">Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br/>

  Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br/>

  His neck and feet continual journey made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00771">And, "If the misery of this soft place<br/>

  Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"<br/>

  Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00772">Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br/>

  To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br/>

  Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00773">He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br/>

  Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br/>

  Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00774">He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br/>

  His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br/>

  Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00775">The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br/>

  Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br/>

  Above there in the world should welcome be.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00776">And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br/>

  Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br/>

  My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00777">Could I have been protected from the fire,<br/>

  Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br/>

  And think the Teacher would have suffered it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00778">But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br/>

  My terror overmastered my good will,<br/>

  Which made me greedy of embracing them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00779">Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain<br/>

  Did your condition fix within me so,<br/>

  That tardily it wholly is stripped off,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00780">As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br/>

  Words, on account of which I thought within me<br/>

  That people such as you are were approaching.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00781">I of your city am; and evermore<br/>

  Your labours and your honourable names<br/>

  I with affection have retraced and heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00782">I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br/>

  Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br/>

  But to the centre first I needs must plunge."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00783">"So may the soul for a long while conduct<br/>

  Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,<br/>

  "And so may thy renown shine after thee,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00784">Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br/>

  Within our city, as they used to do,<br/>

  Or if they wholly have gone out of it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00785">For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br/>

  With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br/>

  Doth greatly mortify us with his words."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00786">"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br/>

  Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br/>

  Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00787">In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br/>

  And the three, taking that for my reply,<br/>

  Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00788">"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"<br/>

  Replied they all, "to satisfy another,<br/>

  Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00789">Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br/>

  And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br/>

  When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00790">See that thou speak of us unto the people."<br/>

  Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br/>

  It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00791">Not an Amen could possibly be said<br/>

  So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br/>

  Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00792">I followed him, and little had we gone,<br/>

  Before the sound of water was so near us,<br/>

  That speaking we should hardly have been heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00793">Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br/>

  The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,<br/>

  Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00794">Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br/>

  It down descendeth into its low bed,<br/>

  And at Forli is vacant of that name,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00795">Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br/>

  From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br/>

  Where for a thousand there were room enough;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00796">Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br/>

  We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br/>

  So that it soon the ear would have offended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00797">I had a cord around about me girt,<br/>

  And therewithal I whilom had designed<br/>

  To take the panther with the painted skin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00798">After I this had all from me unloosed,<br/>

  As my Conductor had commanded me,<br/>

  I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00799">Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br/>

  And at a little distance from the verge,<br/>

  He cast it down into that deep abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00800">"It must needs be some novelty respond,"<br/>

  I said within myself, "to the new signal<br/>

  The Master with his eye is following so."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00801">Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br/>

  With those who not alone behold the act,<br/>

  But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00802">He said to me: "Soon there will upward come<br/>

  What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br/>

  Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00803">Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br/>

  A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br/>

  Because without his fault it causes shame;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00804">But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br/>

  Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br/>

  So may they not be void of lasting favour,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00805">Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br/>

  I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br/>

  Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00806">Even as he returns who goeth down<br/>

  Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br/>

  Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00807">Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>
<p id="id00808" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVII</p>
<p id="id00809" style="margin-top: 2em">"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br/>

  Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br/>

  Behold him who infecteth all the world."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00810">Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br/>

  And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br/>

  Near to the confine of the trodden marble;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00811">And that uncleanly image of deceit<br/>

  Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br/>

  But on the border did not drag its tail.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00812">The face was as the face of a just man,<br/>

  Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br/>

  And of a serpent all the trunk beside.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00813">Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br/>

  The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br/>

  Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00814">With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br/>

  Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br/>

  Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00815">As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br/>

  That part are in the water, part on land;<br/>

  And as among the guzzling Germans there,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00816">The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br/>

  So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br/>

  Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00817">His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br/>

  Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br/>

  That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00818">The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside<br/>

  Our way a little, even to that beast<br/>

  Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00819">We therefore on the right side descended,<br/>

  And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br/>

  Completely to avoid the sand and flame;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00820">And after we are come to him, I see<br/>

  A little farther off upon the sand<br/>

  A people sitting near the hollow place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00821">Then said to me the Master: "So that full<br/>

  Experience of this round thou bear away,<br/>

  Now go and see what their condition is.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00822">There let thy conversation be concise;<br/>

  Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br/>

  That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00823">Thus farther still upon the outermost<br/>

  Head of that seventh circle all alone<br/>

  I went, where sat the melancholy folk.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00824">Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br/>

  This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br/>

  Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00825">Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br/>

  Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br/>

  By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00826">When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br/>

  Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br/>

  Not one of them I knew; but I perceived<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00827">That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br/>

  Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br/>

  And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00828">And as I gazing round me come among them,<br/>

  Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br/>

  That had the face and posture of a lion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00829">Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br/>

  Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br/>

  Display a goose more white than butter is.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00830">And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br/>

  Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br/>

  Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00831">Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,<br/>

  Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br/>

  Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00832">A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br/>

  Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br/>

  Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00833">He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"<br/>

  Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br/>

  His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00834">And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br/>

  Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br/>

  Backward I turned me from those weary souls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00835">I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br/>

  Upon the back of that wild animal,<br/>

  And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00836">Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br/>

  Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br/>

  So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00837">Such as he is who has so near the ague<br/>

  Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br/>

  And trembles all, but looking at the shade;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00838">Even such became I at those proffered words;<br/>

  But shame in me his menaces produced,<br/>

  Which maketh servant strong before good master.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00839">I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br/>

  I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br/>

  As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00840">But he, who other times had rescued me<br/>

  In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br/>

  Within his arms encircled and sustained me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00841">And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br/>

  The circles large, and the descent be little;<br/>

  Think of the novel burden which thou hast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00842">Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br/>

  Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br/>

  And when he wholly felt himself afloat,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00843">There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br/>

  And that extended like an eel he moved,<br/>

  And with his paws drew to himself the air.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00844">A greater fear I do not think there was<br/>

  What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br/>

  Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00845">Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br/>

  Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br/>

  His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00846">Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br/>

  On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br/>

  The sight of everything but of the monster.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00847">Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br/>

  Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br/>

  By wind upon my face and from below.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00848">I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br/>

  Making a horrible crashing under us;<br/>

  Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00849">Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br/>

  Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br/>

  Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00850">I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br/>

  The turning and descending, by great horrors<br/>

  That were approaching upon divers sides.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00851">As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br/>

  Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br/>

  Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00852">Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br/>

  Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br/>

  Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00853">Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br/>

  Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br/>

  And being disencumbered of our persons,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00854">He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>
<p id="id00855" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVIII</p>
<p id="id00856" style="margin-top: 2em">There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br/>

  Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,<br/>

  As is the circle that around it turns.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00857">Right in the middle of the field malign<br/>

  There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,<br/>

  Of which its place the structure will recount.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00858">Round, then, is that enclosure which remains<br/>

  Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br/>

  And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00859">As where for the protection of the walls<br/>

  Many and many moats surround the castles,<br/>

  The part in which they are a figure forms,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00860">Just such an image those presented there;<br/>

  And as about such strongholds from their gates<br/>

  Unto the outer bank are little bridges,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00861">So from the precipice's base did crags<br/>

  Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br/>

  Unto the well that truncates and collects them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00862">Within this place, down shaken from the back<br/>

  Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br/>

  Held to the left, and I moved on behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00863">Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br/>

  New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br/>

  Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00864">Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br/>

  This side the middle came they facing us,<br/>

  Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00865">Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br/>

  The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br/>

  Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00866">For all upon one side towards the Castle<br/>

  Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;<br/>

  On the other side they go towards the Mountain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00867">This side and that, along the livid stone<br/>

  Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br/>

  Who cruelly were beating them behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00868">Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br/>

  At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br/>

  The second waited for, nor for the third.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00869">While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br/>

  Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already<br/>

  With sight of this one I am not unfed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00870">Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br/>

  And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br/>

  And to my going somewhat back assented;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00871">And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br/>

  Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br/>

  For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00872">If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br/>

  Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br/>

  But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00873">And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;<br/>

  But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br/>

  Which makes me recollect the ancient world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00874">I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br/>

  Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br/>

  Howe'er the shameless story may be told.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00875">Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br/>

  Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br/>

<p id="id00876">'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'<br/>

  And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br/>

  Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00877">While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br/>

  A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone<br/>

  Pander, there are no women here for coin."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00878">I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br/>

  Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br/>

  To where a crag projected from the bank.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00879">This very easily did we ascend,<br/>

  And turning to the right along its ridge,<br/>

  From those eternal circles we departed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00880">When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br/>

  Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br/>

  The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00881">The vision of those others evil-born,<br/>

  Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br/>

  Because together with us they have gone."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00882">From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br/>

  Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,<br/>

  And which the scourges in like manner smite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00883">And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br/>

  Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,<br/>

  And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00884">Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br/>

  That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br/>

  The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00885">He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br/>

  After the daring women pitiless<br/>

  Had unto death devoted all their males.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00886">There with his tokens and with ornate words<br/>

  Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br/>

  Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00887">There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br/>

  Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br/>

  And also for Medea is vengeance done.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00888">With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br/>

  And this sufficient be of the first valley<br/>

  To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00889">We were already where the narrow path<br/>

  Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br/>

  Of that a buttress for another arch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00890">Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br/>

  In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br/>

  And with their palms beating upon themselves<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00891">The margins were incrusted with a mould<br/>

  By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br/>

  And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00892">The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br/>

  To give us sight of it, without ascending<br/>

  The arch's back, where most the crag impends.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00893">Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br/>

  I saw a people smothered in a filth<br/>

  That out of human privies seemed to flow;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00894">And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br/>

  I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br/>

  It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00895">He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager<br/>

  To look at me more than the other foul ones?"<br/>

  And I to him: "Because, if I remember,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00896">I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br/>

  And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br/>

  Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00897">And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br/>

  "The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br/>

  Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00898">Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust<br/>

  Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br/>

  That with thine eyes thou well the face attain<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00899">Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br/>

  Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br/>

  And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00900">Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br/>

  Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00911">In all of them the soles were both on fire;<br/>

  Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,<br/>

  They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.<br/>

<p id="id00912">Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont<br/>

<p id="id00922">Such I became, as people are who stand,<br/>

<p id="id00923">Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,<br/>

  'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"<br/>

  And I replied as was imposed on me.<br/>

<p id="id00979">They built their city over those dead bones,<br/>

  And, after her who first the place selected,<br/>

  Mantua named it, without other omen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00980">Its people once within more crowded were,<br/>

  Ere the stupidity of Casalodi<br/>

  From Pinamonte had received deceit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00981">Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest<br/>

  Originate my city otherwise,<br/>

  No falsehood may the verity defraud."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00982">And I: "My Master, thy discourses are<br/>

  To me so certain, and so take my faith,<br/>

  That unto me the rest would be spent coals.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00983">But tell me of the people who are passing,<br/>

  If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,<br/>

  For only unto that my mind reverts."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00984">Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek<br/>

  Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders<br/>

  Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00985">So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,<br/>

  An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,<br/>

  In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00986">Eryphylus his name was, and so sings<br/>

  My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;<br/>

  That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00987">The next, who is so slender in the flanks,<br/>

  Was Michael Scott, who of a verity<br/>

  Of magical illusions knew the game.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00988">Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,<br/>

  Who now unto his leather and his thread<br/>

  Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00989">Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,<br/>

  The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;<br/>

  They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00990">But come now, for already holds the confines<br/>

  Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville<br/>

  Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00991">And yesternight the moon was round already;<br/>

  Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br/>

  From time to time within the forest deep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00992">Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>
<p id="id00993" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXI</p>
<p id="id00994" style="margin-top: 2em">From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br/>

  Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br/>

  We came along, and held the summit, when<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00995">We halted to behold another fissure<br/>

  Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br/>

  And I beheld it marvellously dark.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00996">As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br/>

  Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br/>

  To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00997">For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br/>

  One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br/>

  The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00998">One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br/>

  This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br/>

  Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00999">Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br/>

  Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br/>

  Which upon every side the bank belimed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01000">I saw it, but I did not see within it<br/>

  Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br/>

  And all swell up and resubside compressed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01001">The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br/>

  My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"<br/>

  Drew me unto himself from where I stood.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01002">Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br/>

  To see what it behoves him to escape,<br/>

  And whom a sudden terror doth unman,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01003">Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br/>

  And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br/>

  Running along upon the crag, approach.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01004">Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br/>

  And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br/>

  With open wings and light upon his feet!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01005">His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br/>

  A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br/>

  And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01006">From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,<br/>

  Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br/>

  Plunge him beneath, for I return for others<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01007">Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br/>

  All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br/>

  No into Yes for money there is changed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01008">He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br/>

  Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br/>

  In so much hurry to pursue a thief.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01009">The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br/>

  But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br/>

  Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01010">Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br/>

  Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br/>

  Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01011">They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br/>

  They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br/>

  That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01012">Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br/>

  Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br/>

  The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01013">Said the good Master to me: "That it be not<br/>

  Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br/>

  Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01014">And for no outrage that is done to me<br/>

  Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br/>

  For once before was I in such a scuffle."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01015">Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,<br/>

  And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br/>

  Need was for him to have a steadfast front.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01016">With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br/>

  As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br/>

  Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01017">They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br/>

  And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br/>

  But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01018">Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br/>

  Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br/>

  And then take counsel as to grappling me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01019">They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"<br/>

  Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br/>

  And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01020">"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br/>

  Advanced into this place," my Master said,<br/>

  "Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01021">Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br/>

  Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br/>

  That I another show this savage road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01022">Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br/>

  That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br/>

  And to the others said: "Now strike him not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01023">And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest<br/>

  Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br/>

  Securely now return to me again."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01024">Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br/>

  And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br/>

  So that I feared they would not keep their compact.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01025">And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br/>

  Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br/>

  Seeing themselves among so many foes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01026">Close did I press myself with all my person<br/>

  Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br/>

  From off their countenance, which was not good.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01027">They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"<br/>

  They said to one another, "on the rump?"<br/>

  And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01028">But the same demon who was holding parley<br/>

  With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br/>

  And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01029">Then said to us: "You can no farther go<br/>

  Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br/>

  All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01030">And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br/>

  Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br/>

  Near is another crag that yields a path.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01031">Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br/>

  One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br/>

  Years were complete, that here the way was broken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01032">I send in that direction some of mine<br/>

  To see if any one doth air himself;<br/>

  Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01033">Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"<br/>

  Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;<br/>

  And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01034">Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br/>

  And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br/>

  And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01035">Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br/>

  Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br/>

  That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01036">"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br/>

  Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,<br/>

  If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01037">If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br/>

  Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br/>

  And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01038">And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;<br/>

  Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br/>

  Because they do it for those boiling wretches."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01039">Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br/>

  But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br/>

  His teeth towards their leader for a signal;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01040">And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>
<p id="id01041" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXII</p>
<p id="id01042" style="margin-top: 2em">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br/>

  Begin the storming, and their muster make,<br/>

  And sometimes starting off for their escape;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01043">Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br/>

  O Aretines, and foragers go forth,<br/>

  Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01044">Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,<br/>

  With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,<br/>

  And with our own, and with outlandish things,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01045">But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth<br/>

  Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,<br/>

  Nor ship by any sign of land or star.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01046">We went upon our way with the ten demons;<br/>

  Ah, savage company! but in the church<br/>

  With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01047">Ever upon the pitch was my intent,<br/>

  To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,<br/>

  And of the people who therein were burned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01048">Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign<br/>

  To mariners by arching of the back,<br/>

  That they should counsel take to save their vessel,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01049">Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,<br/>

  One of the sinners would display his back,<br/>

  And in less time conceal it than it lightens.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01050">As on the brink of water in a ditch<br/>

  The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,<br/>

  So that they hide their feet and other bulk,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01051">So upon every side the sinners stood;<br/>

  But ever as Barbariccia near them came,<br/>

  Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01052">I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br/>

  One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br/>

  One frog remains, and down another dives;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01053">And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br/>

  Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br/>

  And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01054">I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br/>

  So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br/>

  And when they called each other, listened how.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01055">"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br/>

  Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"<br/>

  Cried all together the accursed ones.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01056">And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br/>

  That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br/>

  Thus come into his adversaries' hands."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01057">Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br/>

  Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br/>

  "I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01058">My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br/>

  For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br/>

  Destroyer of himself and of his things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01059">Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br/>

  I set me there to practise barratry,<br/>

  For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01060">And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br/>

  On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br/>

  Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01061">Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br/>

  But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br/>

  And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01062">And to my Master he turned round his head;<br/>

  "Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish<br/>

  To know from him, before some one destroy him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01063">The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;<br/>

  Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br/>

  Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01064">Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br/>

  Would that I still were covered up with him,<br/>

  For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01065">And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"<br/>

  And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br/>

  So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01066">Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br/>

  Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br/>

  Turned round and round about with evil look.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01067">When they again somewhat were pacified,<br/>

  Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br/>

  Demanded my Conductor without stay:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01068">"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br/>

  Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"<br/>

  And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01069">He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br/>

  Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br/>

  And dealt so with them each exults thereat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01070">Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br/>

  As he says; and in other offices<br/>

  A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01071">Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br/>

  Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br/>

  To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01072">O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br/>

  Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br/>

  Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01073">And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br/>

  Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br/>

  Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01074">"If you desire either to see or hear,"<br/>

  The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br/>

  "Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01075">But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br/>

  So that these may not their revenges fear,<br/>

  And I, down sitting in this very place,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01076">For one that I am will make seven come,<br/>

  When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br/>

  To do whenever one of us comes out."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01077">Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br/>

  Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick<br/>

  Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01078">Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br/>

  Responded: "I by far too cunning am,<br/>

  When I procure for mine a greater sadness."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01079">Alichin held not in, but running counter<br/>

  Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,<br/>

  I will not follow thee upon the gallop,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01080">But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br/>

  The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br/>

  To see if thou alone dost countervail us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01081">O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br/>

  Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br/>

  He first, who most reluctant was to do it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01082">The Navarrese selected well his time;<br/>

  Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br/>

  Leaped, and released himself from their design.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01083">Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br/>

  But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br/>

  Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01084">But little it availed, for wings could not<br/>

  Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br/>

  And, flying, upward he his breast directed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01085">Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br/>

  Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br/>

  And upward he returneth cross and weary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01086">Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br/>

  Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br/>

  The other should escape, to have a quarrel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01087">And when the barrator had disappeared,<br/>

  He turned his talons upon his companion,<br/>

  And grappled with him right above the moat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01088">But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br/>

  To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br/>

  Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01089">A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br/>

  But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,<br/>

  To such degree they had their wings belimed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01090">Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br/>

  Made four of them fly to the other side<br/>

  With all their gaffs, and very speedily<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01091">This side and that they to their posts descended;<br/>

  They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br/>

  Who were already baked within the crust,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01092">And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>
<p id="id01093" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIII</p>
<p id="id01094" style="margin-top: 2em">Silent, alone, and without company<br/>

  We went, the one in front, the other after,<br/>

  As go the Minor Friars along their way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01095">Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br/>

  My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br/>

  Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01096">For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike<br/>

  Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br/>

  End and beginning with a steadfast mind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01097">And even as one thought from another springs,<br/>

  So afterward from that was born another,<br/>

  Which the first fear within me double made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01098">Thus did I ponder: "These on our account<br/>

  Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br/>

  So great, that much I think it must annoy them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01099">If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br/>

  They will come after us more merciless<br/>

  Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01100">I felt my hair stand all on end already<br/>

  With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br/>

  When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01101">Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br/>

  I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br/>

  I so imagine them, I already feel them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01102">And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,<br/>

  Thine outward image I should not attract<br/>

  Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01103">Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br/>

  With similar attitude and similar face,<br/>

  So that of both one counsel sole I made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01104">If peradventure the right bank so slope<br/>

  That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br/>

  We shall escape from the imagined chase."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01105">Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br/>

  When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br/>

  Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01106">My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br/>

  Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br/>

  And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01107">Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br/>

  Having more care of him than of herself,<br/>

  So that she clothes her only with a shift;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01108">And downward from the top of the hard bank<br/>

  Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br/>

  That one side of the other Bolgia walls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01109">Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br/>

  To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br/>

  When nearest to the paddles it approaches,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01110">As did my Master down along that border,<br/>

  Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br/>

  As his own son, and not as a companion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01111">Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br/>

  His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br/>

  Right over us; but he was not afraid;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01112">For the high Providence, which had ordained<br/>

  To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br/>

  The power of thence departing took from all.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01113">A painted people there below we found,<br/>

  Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br/>

  Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01114">They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br/>

  Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br/>

  That in Cologne they for the monks are made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01115">Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br/>

  But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br/>

  That Frederick used to put them on of straw.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01116">O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br/>

  Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br/>

  Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01117">But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br/>

  Came on so tardily, that we were new<br/>

  In company at each motion of the haunch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01118">Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find<br/>

  Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br/>

  And thus in going move thine eye about."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01119">And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br/>

  Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,<br/>

  Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01120">Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."<br/>

  Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,<br/>

  And then according to his pace proceed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01121">I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br/>

  Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br/>

  But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01122">When they came up, long with an eye askance<br/>

  They scanned me without uttering a word.<br/>

  Then to each other turned, and said together:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01123">"He by the action of his throat seems living;<br/>

  And if they dead are, by what privilege<br/>

  Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01124">Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college<br/>

  Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br/>

  Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01125">And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up<br/>

  In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br/>

  And with the body am I've always had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01126">But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br/>

  Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br/>

  And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01127">And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks<br/>

  Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br/>

  Cause in this way their balances to creak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01128">Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br/>

  I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br/>

  Named, and together taken by thy city,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01129">As the wont is to take one man alone,<br/>

  For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br/>

  That still it is apparent round Gardingo."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01130">"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."<br/>

  But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br/>

  One crucified with three stakes on the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01131">When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br/>

  Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br/>

  And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01132">Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br/>

  Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br/>

  To put one man to torture for the people.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01133">Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br/>

  As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br/>

  Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01134">And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br/>

  Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br/>

  Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01135">And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br/>

  O'er him who was extended on the cross<br/>

  So vilely in eternal banishment.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01136">Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br/>

  "Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br/>

  If to the right hand any pass slope down<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01137">By which we two may issue forth from here,<br/>

  Without constraining some of the black angels<br/>

  To come and extricate us from this deep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01138">Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest<br/>

  There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br/>

  Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01139">Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br/>

  You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br/>

  That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01140">The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br/>

  Then said: "The business badly he recounted<br/>

  Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01141">And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices<br/>

  Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br/>

  That he's a liar and the father of lies."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01142">Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br/>

  Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br/>

  Whence from the heavy-laden I departed<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01143">After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>
<p id="id01144" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIV</p>
<p id="id01145" style="margin-top: 2em">In that part of the youthful year wherein<br/>

  The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br/>

  And now the nights draw near to half the day,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01146">What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br/>

  The outward semblance of her sister white,<br/>

  But little lasts the temper of her pen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01147">The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br/>

  Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br/>

  All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01148">Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br/>

  Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br/>

  Then he returns and hope revives again,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01149">Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br/>

  In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,<br/>

  And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01150">Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br/>

  When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br/>

  And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01151">For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br/>

  The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br/>

  Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01152">His arms he opened, after some advisement<br/>

  Within himself elected, looking first<br/>

  Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01153">And even as he who acts and meditates,<br/>

  For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br/>

  So upward lifting me towards the summit<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01154">Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br/>

  Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,<br/>

  But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01155">This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br/>

  For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br/>

  Were able to ascend from jag to jag.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01156">And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br/>

  Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br/>

  He I know not, but I had been dead beat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01157">But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth<br/>

  Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br/>

  The structure of each valley doth import<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01158">That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br/>

  Still we arrived at length upon the point<br/>

  Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01159">The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br/>

  When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br/>

  Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01160">"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"<br/>

  My Master said; "for sitting upon down,<br/>

  Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01161">Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br/>

  Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br/>

  As smoke in air or in the water foam.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01162">And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish<br/>

  With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,<br/>

  If with its heavy body it sink not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01163">A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br/>

  'Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br/>

  Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01164">Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br/>

  Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br/>

  And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01165">Upward we took our way along the crag,<br/>

  Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br/>

  And more precipitous far than that before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01166">Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br/>

  Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br/>

  Not well adapted to articulate words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01167">I know not what it said, though o'er the back<br/>

  I now was of the arch that passes there;<br/>

  But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01168">I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br/>

  Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br/>

  Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01169">At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br/>

  For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br/>

  So I look down and nothing I distinguish."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01170">"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,<br/>

  Except the doing; for the modest asking<br/>

  Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01171">We from the bridge descended at its head,<br/>

  Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br/>

  And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01172">And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br/>

  Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br/>

  That the remembrance still congeals my blood<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01173">Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br/>

  For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br/>

  She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01174">Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br/>

  E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br/>

  Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01175">Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br/>

  People were running naked and affrighted.<br/>

  Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01176">They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br/>

  These riveted upon their reins the tail<br/>

  And head, and were in front of them entwined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01177">And lo! at one who was upon our side<br/>

  There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br/>

  There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01178">Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,<br/>

  As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br/>

  Behoved it that in falling he became.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01179">And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br/>

  The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br/>

  Into himself they instantly returned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01180">Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed<br/>

  The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br/>

  When it approaches its five-hundredth year;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01181">On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br/>

  But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br/>

  And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01182">And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br/>

  By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br/>

  Or other oppilation that binds man,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01183">When he arises and around him looks,<br/>

  Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br/>

  Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01184">Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br/>

  Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br/>

  That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01185">The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br/>

  Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany<br/>

  A short time since into this cruel gorge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01186">A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br/>

  Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,<br/>

  Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01187">And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,<br/>

  And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br/>

  For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01188">And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br/>

  But unto me directed mind and face,<br/>

  And with a melancholy shame was painted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01189">Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br/>

  Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br/>

  Than when I from the other life was taken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01190">What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br/>

  So low am I put down because I robbed<br/>

  The sacristy of the fair ornaments,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01191">And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;<br/>

  But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,<br/>

  If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01192">Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:<br/>

  Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<br/>

  Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01193">Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,<br/>

  Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,<br/>

  And with impetuous and bitter tempest<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01194">Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;<br/>

  When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,<br/>

  So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01195">And this I've said that it may give thee pain."</p>
<p id="id01196" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXV</p>
<p id="id01197" style="margin-top: 2em">At the conclusion of his words, the thief<br/>

  Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<br/>

  Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01198">From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br/>

  For one entwined itself about his neck<br/>

  As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01199">And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br/>

  Clinching itself together so in front,<br/>

  That with them he could not a motion make.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01200">Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<br/>

  To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,<br/>

  Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01201">Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br/>

  Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br/>

  Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01202">He fled away, and spake no further word;<br/>

  And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br/>

  Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01203">I do not think Maremma has so many<br/>

  Serpents as he had all along his back,<br/>

  As far as where our countenance begins.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01204">Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br/>

  With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br/>

  And he sets fire to all that he encounters.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01205">My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who<br/>

  Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br/>

  Created oftentimes a lake of blood.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01206">He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br/>

  By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br/>

  Of the great herd, which he had near to him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01207">Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br/>

  The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br/>

  Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01208">While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br/>

  And spirits three had underneath us come,<br/>

  Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01209">Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"<br/>

  On which account our story made a halt,<br/>

  And then we were intent on them alone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01210">I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br/>

  As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br/>

  That one to name the other was compelled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01211">Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"<br/>

  Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br/>

  Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01212">If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br/>

  What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br/>

  For I who saw it hardly can admit it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01213">As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br/>

  Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br/>

  In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01214">With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br/>

  And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br/>

  Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01215">The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br/>

  And put its tail through in between the two,<br/>

  And up behind along the reins outspread it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01216">Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br/>

  Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br/>

  Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01217">Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br/>

  They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br/>

  Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01218">E'en as proceedeth on before the flame<br/>

  Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br/>

  Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01219">The other two looked on, and each of them<br/>

  Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br/>

  Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01220">Already the two heads had one become,<br/>

  When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br/>

  Into one face, wherein the two were lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01221">Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br/>

  The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br/>

  Members became that never yet were seen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01222">Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br/>

  Two and yet none did the perverted image<br/>

  Appear, and such departed with slow pace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01223">Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br/>

  Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br/>

  Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01224">Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br/>

  Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br/>

  Livid and black as is a peppercorn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01225">And in that part whereat is first received<br/>

  Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br/>

  Then downward fell in front of him extended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01226">The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br/>

  Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br/>

  Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01227">He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br/>

  One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br/>

  Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01228">Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br/>

  Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br/>

  And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01229">Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br/>

  For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br/>

  Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01230">Because two natures never front to front<br/>

  Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br/>

  To interchange their matter ready were.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01231">Together they responded in such wise,<br/>

  That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br/>

  And eke the wounded drew his feet together.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01232">The legs together with the thighs themselves<br/>

  Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br/>

  No sign whatever made that was apparent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01233">He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br/>

  The other one was losing, and his skin<br/>

  Became elastic, and the other's hard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01234">I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br/>

  And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br/>

  Lengthen as much as those contracted were.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01235">Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br/>

  Became the member that a man conceals,<br/>

  And of his own the wretch had two created.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01236">While both of them the exhalation veils<br/>

  With a new colour, and engenders hair<br/>

  On one of them and depilates the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01237">The one uprose and down the other fell,<br/>

  Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br/>

  Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01238">He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,<br/>

  And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br/>

  Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01239">What did not backward run and was retained<br/>

  Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br/>

  And the lips thickened far as was befitting.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01240">He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br/>

  And backward draws the ears into his head,<br/>

  In the same manner as the snail its horns;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01241">And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br/>

  For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br/>

  In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01242">The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br/>

  Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br/>

  And after him the other speaking sputters.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01243">Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br/>

  And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,<br/>

  Crawling as I have done, along this road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01244">In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br/>

  Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br/>

  The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01245">And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br/>

  Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br/>

  They could not flee away so secretly<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01246">But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br/>

  And he it was who sole of three companions,<br/>

  Which came in the beginning, was not changed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01247">The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>
<p id="id01248" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVI</p>
<p id="id01249" style="margin-top: 2em">Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,<br/>

  That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,<br/>

  And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01250">Among the thieves five citizens of thine<br/>

  Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,<br/>

  And thou thereby to no great honour risest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01251">But if when morn is near our dreams are true,<br/>

  Feel shalt thou in a little time from now<br/>

  What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.<br/>

<p id="id01252">And if it now were, it were not too soon;<br/>

  Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,<br/>

  For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01253">We went our way, and up along the stairs<br/>

  The bourns had made us to descend before,<br/>

  Remounted my Conductor and drew me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01254">And following the solitary path<br/>

  Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,<br/>

  The foot without the hand sped not at all.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01255">Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,<br/>

  When I direct my mind to what I saw,<br/>

  And more my genius curb than I am wont,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01256">That it may run not unless virtue guide it;<br/>

  So that if some good star, or better thing,<br/>

  Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01257">As many as the hind (who on the hill<br/>

  Rests at the time when he who lights the world<br/>

  His countenance keeps least concealed from us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01258">While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)<br/>

  Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,<br/>

  Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01259">With flames as manifold resplendent all<br/>

  Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br/>

  As soon as I was where the depth appeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01260">And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br/>

  Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,<br/>

  What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01261">For with his eye he could not follow it<br/>

  So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br/>

  Even as a little cloud ascending upward,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01262">Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br/>

  Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br/>

  And every flame a sinner steals away.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01263">I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br/>

  So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br/>

  Down had I fallen without being pushed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01264">And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br/>

  Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;<br/>

  Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01265">"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee<br/>

  I am more sure; but I surmised already<br/>

  It might be so, and already wished to ask thee<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01266">Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br/>

  At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br/>

  Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01267">He answered me: "Within there are tormented<br/>

  Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br/>

  They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01268">And there within their flame do they lament<br/>

  The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br/>

  Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01269">Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br/>

  Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br/>

  And pain for the Palladium there is borne."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01270">"If they within those sparks possess the power<br/>

  To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,<br/>

  And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01271">That thou make no denial of awaiting<br/>

  Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br/>

  Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01272">And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty<br/>

  Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br/>

  But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01273">Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br/>

  That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br/>

  Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01274">When now the flame had come unto that point,<br/>

  Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br/>

  After this fashion did I hear him speak:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01275">"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br/>

  If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br/>

  If I deserved of you or much or little<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01276">When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br/>

  Do not move on, but one of you declare<br/>

  Whither, being lost, he went away to die."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01277">Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br/>

  Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br/>

  Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01278">Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br/>

  Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br/>

  It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01279">From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br/>

  More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br/>

  Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01280">Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br/>

  For my old father, nor the due affection<br/>

  Which joyous should have made Penelope,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01281">Could overcome within me the desire<br/>

  I had to be experienced of the world,<br/>

  And of the vice and virtue of mankind;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01282">But I put forth on the high open sea<br/>

  With one sole ship, and that small company<br/>

  By which I never had deserted been.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01283">Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br/>

  Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br/>

  And the others which that sea bathes round about.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01284">I and my company were old and slow<br/>

  When at that narrow passage we arrived<br/>

  Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01285">That man no farther onward should adventure.<br/>

  On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br/>

  And on the other already had left Ceuta.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01286">'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br/>

  Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,<br/>

  To this so inconsiderable vigil<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01287">Which is remaining of your senses still<br/>

  Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br/>

  Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01288">Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br/>

  Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br/>

  But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01289">So eager did I render my companions,<br/>

  With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br/>

  That then I hardly could have held them back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01290">And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br/>

  We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br/>

  Evermore gaining on the larboard side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01291">Already all the stars of the other pole<br/>

  The night beheld, and ours so very low<br/>

  It did not rise above the ocean floor.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01292">Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br/>

  Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br/>

  Since we had entered into the deep pass,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01293">When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br/>

  From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br/>

  As I had never any one beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01294">Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br/>

  For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br/>

  And smote upon the fore part of the ship.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01295">Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br/>

  At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br/>

  And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01296">Until the sea above us closed again."</p>
<p id="id01297" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVII</p>
<p id="id01298" style="margin-top: 2em">Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br/>

  To speak no more, and now departed from us<br/>

  With the permission of the gentle Poet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01299">When yet another, which behind it came,<br/>

  Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br/>

  By a confused sound that issued from it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01300">As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br/>

  With the lament of him, and that was right,<br/>

  Who with his file had modulated it)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01301">Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,<br/>

  That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,<br/>

  Still it appeared with agony transfixed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01302">Thus, by not having any way or issue<br/>

  At first from out the fire, to its own language<br/>

  Converted were the melancholy words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01303">But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br/>

  Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br/>

  The tongue had given them in their passage out,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01304">We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim<br/>

  My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,<br/>

  Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01305">Because I come perchance a little late,<br/>

  To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br/>

  Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01306">If thou but lately into this blind world<br/>

  Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,<br/>

  Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01307">Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,<br/>

  For I was from the mountains there between<br/>

  Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01308">I still was downward bent and listening,<br/>

  When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br/>

  Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01309">And I, who had beforehand my reply<br/>

  In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br/>

  "O soul, that down below there art concealed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01310">Romagna thine is not and never has been<br/>

  Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;<br/>

  But open war I none have left there now.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01311">Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;<br/>

  The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br/>

  So that she covers Cervia with her vans.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01312">The city which once made the long resistance,<br/>

  And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br/>

  Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01313">Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,<br/>

  Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,<br/>

  Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01314">The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br/>

  Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br/>

  Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01315">And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br/>

  Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br/>

  Lives between tyranny and a free state.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01316">Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br/>

  Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br/>

  So may thy name hold front there in the world."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01317">After the fire a little more had roared<br/>

  In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br/>

  This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01318">"If I believed that my reply were made<br/>

  To one who to the world would e'er return,<br/>

  This flame without more flickering would stand still;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01319">But inasmuch as never from this depth<br/>

  Did any one return, if I hear true,<br/>

  Without the fear of infamy I answer,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01320">I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br/>

  Believing thus begirt to make amends;<br/>

  And truly my belief had been fulfilled<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01321">But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,<br/>

  Who put me back into my former sins;<br/>

  And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01322">While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br/>

  My mother gave to me, the deeds I did<br/>

  Were not those of a lion, but a fox.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01323">The machinations and the covert ways<br/>

  I knew them all, and practised so their craft,<br/>

  That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01324">When now unto that portion of mine age<br/>

  I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br/>

  To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01325">That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br/>

  And penitent and confessing I surrendered,<br/>

  Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01326">The Leader of the modern Pharisees<br/>

  Having a war near unto Lateran,<br/>

  And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01327">For each one of his enemies was Christian,<br/>

  And none of them had been to conquer Acre,<br/>

  Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01328">Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,<br/>

  In him regarded, nor in me that cord<br/>

  Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01329">But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<br/>

  To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,<br/>

  So this one sought me out as an adept<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01330">To cure him of the fever of his pride.<br/>

  Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,<br/>

  Because his words appeared inebriate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01331">And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;<br/>

  Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me<br/>

  How to raze Palestrina to the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01332">Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,<br/>

  As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,<br/>

  The which my predecessor held not dear.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01333">Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br/>

  There, where my silence was the worst advice;<br/>

  And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01334">Of that sin into which I now must fall,<br/>

  The promise long with the fulfilment short<br/>

  Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01335">Francis came afterward, when I was dead,<br/>

  For me; but one of the black Cherubim<br/>

  Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01336">He must come down among my servitors,<br/>

  Because he gave the fraudulent advice<br/>

  From which time forth I have been at his hair;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01337">For who repents not cannot be absolved,<br/>

  Nor can one both repent and will at once,<br/>

  Because of the contradiction which consents not.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01338">O miserable me! how I did shudder<br/>

  When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure<br/>

  Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01339">He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br/>

  Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br/>

  And after he had bitten it in great rage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01340">Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'<br/>

  Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,<br/>

  And vested thus in going I bemoan me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01341">When it had thus completed its recital,<br/>

  The flame departed uttering lamentations,<br/>

  Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01342">Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,<br/>

  Up o'er the crag above another arch,<br/>

  Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee<br/>

<p id="id01352">A cask by losing centre-piece or cant<br/>

  Was never shattered so, as I saw one<br/>

  Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01353">Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;<br/>

  His heart was visible, and the dismal sack<br/>

  That maketh excrement of what is eaten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01354">While I was all absorbed in seeing him,<br/>

  He looked at me, and opened with his hands<br/>

  His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;<br/>

<p id="id01360">"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01362">More than a hundred were there when they heard him,<br/>

<p id="id01365">After one foot to go away he lifted,<br/>

  With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,<br/>

  Curio, who in speaking was so bold!<br/>

<p id="id01379">And one, who both his hands dissevered had,<br/>

  The stumps uplifting through the murky air,<br/>

  So that the blood made horrible his face,<br/>

<p id="id01380">Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<br/>

<p id="id01381">"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;<br/>

  Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,<br/>

  Departed, like a person sad and crazed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01382">But I remained to look upon the crowd;<br/>

  And saw a thing which I should be afraid,<br/>

  Without some further proof, even to recount,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01383">If it were not that conscience reassures me,<br/>

  That good companion which emboldens man<br/>

  Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01384">I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,<br/>

  A trunk without a head walk in like manner<br/>

  As walked the others of the mournful herd.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01385">And by the hair it held the head dissevered,<br/>

  Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,<br/>

  And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01386">It of itself made to itself a lamp,<br/>

  And they were two in one, and one in two;<br/>

  How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01387">When it was come close to the bridge's foot,<br/>

  It lifted high its arm with all the head,<br/>

  To bring more closely unto us its words,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01388">Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,<br/>

  Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;<br/>

  Behold if any be as great as this.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01389">And so that thou may carry news of me,<br/>

  Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same<br/>

  Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01390">I made the father and the son rebellious;<br/>

  Achitophel not more with Absalom<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01391">Because I parted persons so united,<br/>

  Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!<br/>

  From its beginning, which is in this trunk.<br/>

<p id="id01393" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIX</p>
<p id="id01394" style="margin-top: 2em">The many people and the divers wounds<br/>

  These eyes of mine had so inebriated,<br/>

  That they were wishful to stand still and weep;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01395">But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?<br/>

  Why is thy sight still riveted down there<br/>

  Among the mournful, mutilated shades?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01396">Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;<br/>

  Consider, if to count them thou believest,<br/>

  That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01397">And now the moon is underneath our feet;<br/>

  Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,<br/>

  And more is to be seen than what thou seest."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01398">"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,<br/>

  "Attended to the cause for which I looked,<br/>

  Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01399">Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him<br/>

  I went, already making my reply,<br/>

  And superadding: "In that cavern where<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01400">I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br/>

  I think a spirit of my blood laments<br/>

  The sin which down below there costs so much."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01401">Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken<br/>

  Thy thought from this time forward upon him;<br/>

  Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01402">For him I saw below the little bridge,<br/>

  Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger<br/>

  Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01403">So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br/>

  By him who formerly held Altaforte,<br/>

  Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."<br/>

<p id="id01404">"O my Conductor, his own violent death,<br/>

<p id="id01405">Made him disdainful; whence he went away,<br/>

  As I imagine, without speaking to me,<br/>

  And thereby made me pity him the more."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01406">Thus did we speak as far as the first place<br/>

  Upon the crag, which the next valley shows<br/>

  Down to the bottom, if there were more light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01407">When we were now right over the last cloister<br/>

<p id="id01408">Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,<br/>

<p id="id01410">All the diseases in one moat were gathered,<br/>

  Such was it here, and such a stench came from it<br/>

  As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01411">We had descended on the furthest bank<br/>

  From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br/>

  And then more vivid was my power of sight<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01412">Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress<br/>

  Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,<br/>

  Punishes forgers, which she here records.<br/>

<p id="id01414">The animals, down to the little worm,<br/>

  All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,<br/>

  According as the poets have affirmed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01415">Were from the seed of ants restored again,)<br/>

  Than was it to behold through that dark valley<br/>

  The spirits languishing in divers heaps.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01416">This on the belly, that upon the back<br/>

  One of the other lay, and others crawling<br/>

  Shifted themselves along the dismal road.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01417">We step by step went onward without speech,<br/>

  Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br/>

  Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01418">I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br/>

  As leans in heating platter against platter,<br/>

  From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01419">And never saw I plied a currycomb<br/>

  By stable-boy for whom his master waits,<br/>

  Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01420">As every one was plying fast the bite<br/>

  Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br/>

  Of itching which no other succour had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01421">And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br/>

  In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br/>

  Or any other fish that has them largest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01422">"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"<br/>

  Began my Leader unto one of them,<br/>

  "And makest of them pincers now and then,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01423">Tell me if any Latian is with those<br/>

  Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee<br/>

  To all eternity unto this work."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01424">"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br/>

  Both of us here," one weeping made reply;<br/>

  "But who art thou, that questionest about us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01425">And said the Guide: "One am I who descends<br/>

  Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br/>

  And I intend to show Hell unto him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01426">Then broken was their mutual support,<br/>

  And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br/>

  With others who had heard him by rebound.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01427">Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br/>

  Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."<br/>

  And I began, since he would have it so:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01428">"So may your memory not steal away<br/>

  In the first world from out the minds of men,<br/>

  But so may it survive 'neath many suns,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01429">Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br/>

  Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br/>

  Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01430">"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,<br/>

  "And Albert of Siena had me burned;<br/>

  But what I died for does not bring me here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01431">'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,<br/>

  That I could rise by flight into the air,<br/>

  And he who had conceit, but little wit,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01432">Would have me show to him the art; and only<br/>

  Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<br/>

  Be burned by one who held him as his son.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01433">But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br/>

  For alchemy, which in the world I practised,<br/>

  Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01434">And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever<br/>

  So vain a people as the Sienese?<br/>

  Not for a certainty the French by far."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01435">Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br/>

  Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,<br/>

<p id="id01510">And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br/>

  Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br/>

  More just and more discreet will hold her for it;<br/>

<p id="id01511">For where the argument of intellect<br/>

  Is added unto evil will and power,<br/>

  No rampart can the people make against it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01512">His face appeared to me as long and large<br/>

  As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,<br/>

  And in proportion were the other bones;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01513">So that the margin, which an apron was<br/>

  Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br/>

  Above it, that to reach up to his hair<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01514">Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br/>

  For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br/>

  Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01515">"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"<br/>

  Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,<br/>

  To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01516">And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,<br/>

  Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br/>

  When wrath or other passion touches thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01517">Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br/>

  Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br/>

  And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01518">Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;<br/>

  This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br/>

  One language in the world is not still used.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01519">Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br/>

  For even such to him is every language<br/>

  As his to others, which to none is known."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01520">Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br/>

  Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br/>

  We found another far more fierce and large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01521">In binding him, who might the master be<br/>

  I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br/>

  Behind the right arm, and in front the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01522">With chains, that held him so begirt about<br/>

  From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br/>

  It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01523">"This proud one wished to make experiment<br/>

  Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"<br/>

  My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01524">Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br/>

  What time the giants terrified the gods;<br/>

  The arms he wielded never more he moves."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01525">And I to him: "If possible, I should wish<br/>

  That of the measureless Briareus<br/>

  These eyes of mine might have experience."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01526">Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br/>

  Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br/>

  Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01527">Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br/>

  And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br/>

  Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01528">There never was an earthquake of such might<br/>

  That it could shake a tower so violently,<br/>

  As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01529">Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br/>

  For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br/>

  If I had not beheld the manacles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01530">Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br/>

  And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br/>

  Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01531">"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br/>

  Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br/>

  When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01532">Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br/>

  And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br/>

  Among thy brothers, some it seems still think<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01533">The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br/>

  Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br/>

  There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01534">Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br/>

  This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br/>

  Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01535">Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br/>

  Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br/>

  If to itself Grace call him not untimely."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01536">So said the Master; and in haste the other<br/>

  His hands extended and took up my Guide,—<br/>

  Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01537">Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"<br/>

  Then of himself and me one bundle made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01538">As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br/>

  Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br/>

  Above it so that opposite it hangs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01539">Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br/>

  Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br/>

  I could have wished to go some other way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01540">But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br/>

  Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br/>

  Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01541">But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>

</p>
<p id="id01544">I would press out the juice of my conception<br/>

  More fully; but because I have them not,<br/>

  Not without fear I bring myself to speak;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01545">For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br/>

  To sketch the bottom of all the universe,<br/>

  Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.<br/>

  Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,<br/>

  And I was scanning still the lofty wall,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01549">I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!<br/>

  Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br/>

  The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01550">Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br/>

  And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br/>

  The semblance had of glass, and not of water.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01551">So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current<br/>

  In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br/>

  Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01552">As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br/>

  Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br/>

  E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01553">And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br/>

  With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming<br/>

  Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01554">Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br/>

  Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br/>

  Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01555">Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br/>

  From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br/>

  Among them witness of itself procures.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01556">When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br/>

  I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br/>

  The hair upon their heads together mingled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01557">"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"<br/>

  I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,<br/>

  And when to me their faces they had lifted,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01558">Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br/>

  Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br/>

  The tears between, and locked them up again.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01559">Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br/>

  So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br/>

  Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01560">And one, who had by reason of the cold<br/>

  Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br/>

  Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01561">If thou desire to know who these two are,<br/>

  The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br/>

  Belonged to them and to their father Albert.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01562">They from one body came, and all Caina<br/>

  Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br/>

  More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01563">Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br/>

  At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;<br/>

  Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01564">So with his head I see no farther forward,<br/>

  And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br/>

  Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01565">And that thou put me not to further speech,<br/>

  Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,<br/>

  And wait Carlino to exonerate me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01566">Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br/>

  Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,<br/>

  And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01567">And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,<br/>

  Where everything of weight unites together,<br/>

  And I was shivering in the eternal shade,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01568">Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br/>

  I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads<br/>

  I struck my foot hard in the face of one.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01569">Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?<br/>

  Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br/>

  of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01570">And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,<br/>

  That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br/>

  Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01571">The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br/>

  Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br/>

  "Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01572">"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br/>

  Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,<br/>

  So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01573">"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"<br/>

  Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,<br/>

  That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01574">And he to me: "For the reverse I long;<br/>

  Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br/>

  For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01575">Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br/>

  And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,<br/>

  Or not a hair remain upon thee here."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01576">Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,<br/>

  I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br/>

  If on my head a thousand times thou fall."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01577">I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br/>

  And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br/>

  He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01578">When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br/>

  Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br/>

  But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01579">"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,<br/>

  Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br/>

  I will report of thee veracious news."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01580">"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,<br/>

  But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br/>

  Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01581">He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br/>

  'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera<br/>

  There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01582">If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br/>

  Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,<br/>

  Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01583">Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be<br/>

  Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello<br/>

  Who oped Faenza when the people slep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01584">Already we had gone away from him,<br/>

  When I beheld two frozen in one hole,<br/>

  So that one head a hood was to the other;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01585">And even as bread through hunger is devoured,<br/>

  The uppermost on the other set his teeth,<br/>

  There where the brain is to the nape united.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01586">Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed<br/>

  The temples of Menalippus in disdain,<br/>

  Than that one did the skull and the other things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01587">"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br/>

  Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br/>

  Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01588">That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br/>

  In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,<br/>

  I in the world above repay thee for it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01589">If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."</p>
<p id="id01590" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXXIII</p>
<p id="id01591" style="margin-top: 2em">His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,<br/>

  That sinner, wiping it upon the hair<br/>

  Of the same head that he behind had wasted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01592">Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew<br/>

  The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br/>

  To think of only, ere I speak of it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01593">But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br/>

  Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br/>

  Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01594">I know not who thou art, nor by what mode<br/>

  Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine<br/>

  Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01595">Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<br/>

  And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;<br/>

  Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01596">That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,<br/>

  Trusting in him I was made prisoner,<br/>

  And after put to death, I need not say;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01597"> But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,<br/>

  That is to say, how cruel was my death,<br/>

  Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01598">A narrow perforation in the mew,<br/>

  Which bears because of me the title of Famine,<br/>

  And in which others still must be locked up,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01599">Had shown me through its opening many moons<br/>

  Already, when I dreamed the evil dream<br/>

  Which of the future rent for me the veil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01600">This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br/>

  Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain<br/>

  For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01601">With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br/>

  Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br/>

  He had sent out before him to the front.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01602">After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br/>

  The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br/>

  It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01603">When I before the morrow was awake,<br/>

  Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br/>

  Who with me were, and asking after bread.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01604">Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br/>

  Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br/>

  And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01605">They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br/>

  At which our food used to be brought to us,<br/>

  And through his dream was each one apprehensive;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01606">And I heard locking up the under door<br/>

  Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br/>

  I gazed into the faces of my sons.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01607">I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br/>

  They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br/>

  Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01608">Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br/>

  All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,<br/>

  Until another sun rose on the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01609">As now a little glimmer made its way<br/>

  Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br/>

  Upon four faces my own very aspect,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01610">Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br/>

  And, thinking that I did it from desire<br/>

  Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01611">And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us<br/>

  If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br/>

  With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01612">I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br/>

  That day we all were silent, and the next.<br/>

  Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01613">When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br/>

  Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,<br/>

  Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01614">And there he died; and, as thou seest me,<br/>

  I saw the three fall, one by one, between<br/>

  The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01615">Already blind, to groping over each,<br/>

  And three days called them after they were dead;<br/>

  Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01616">When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br/>

  The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br/>

  Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01617">Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br/>

  Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,<br/>

  Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01618">Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br/>

  And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br/>

  That every person in thee it may drown!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01619">For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br/>

  Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br/>

  Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01620">Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br/>

  Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br/>

  And the other two my song doth name above!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01621">We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br/>

  Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br/>

  Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01622">Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br/>

  And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br/>

  Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01623">Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br/>

  And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br/>

  Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01624">And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br/>

  Because of cold all sensibility<br/>

  Its station had abandoned in my face,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01625">Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br/>

  Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?<br/>

  Is not below here every vapour quenched?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01626">Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where<br/>

  Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br/>

  Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01627">And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br/>

  Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless<br/>

  That the last post is given unto you,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01628">Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br/>

  May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br/>

  A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01629">Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee<br/>

  Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br/>

  May I go to the bottom of the ice."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01630">Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;<br/>

  He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br/>

  Who here a date am getting for my fig."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01631">"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"<br/>

  And he to me: "How may my body fare<br/>

  Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01632">Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br/>

  That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br/>

  Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01633">And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br/>

  From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br/>

  Know that as soon as any soul betrays<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01634">As I have done, his body by a demon<br/>

  Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br/>

  Until his time has wholly been revolved.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01635">Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br/>

  And still perchance above appears the body<br/>

  Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01636">This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br/>

  It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years<br/>

  Have passed away since he was thus locked up."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01637">"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;<br/>

  For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,<br/>

  And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01638">"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,<br/>

  There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br/>

  As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01639">When this one left a devil in his stead<br/>

  In his own body and one near of kin,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01640">But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br/>

  Open mine eyes;"—and open them I did not,<br/>

  And to be rude to him was courtesy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01641">Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br/>

  With every virtue, full of every vice<br/>

  Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01642">For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<br/>

  Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"<br/>

  My Master said, "if thou discernest him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01646">As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when<br/>

  Our hemisphere is darkening into night,<br/>

  Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01647">Methought that such a building then I saw;<br/>

  And, for the wind, I drew myself behind<br/>

  My Guide, because there was no other shelter.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01648">Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,<br/>

  There where the shades were wholly covered up,<br/>

  And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01649">Some prone are lying, others stand erect,<br/>

  This with the head, and that one with the soles;<br/>

  Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01650">When in advance so far we had proceeded,<br/>

  That it my Master pleased to show to me<br/>

  The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01651">He from before me moved and made me stop,<br/>

  Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place<br/>

  Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01652">How frozen I became and powerless then,<br/>

  Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br/>

  Because all language would be insufficient.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01653">I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br/>

  Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br/>

  What I became, being of both deprived.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01654">The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br/>

  From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br/>

  And better with a giant I compare<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01655">Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br/>

  Consider now how great must be that whole,<br/>

  Which unto such a part conforms itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01656">Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br/>

  And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br/>

  Well may proceed from him all tribulation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01657">O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br/>

  When I beheld three faces on his head!<br/>

  The one in front, and that vermilion was;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01658">Two were the others, that were joined with this<br/>

  Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br/>

  And they were joined together at the crest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01659">And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;<br/>

  The left was such to look upon as those<br/>

  Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01660">Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br/>

  Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br/>

  Sails of the sea I never saw so large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01661"> No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br/>

  Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br/>

  So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01662">Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br/>

  With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br/>

  Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01663">At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br/>

  A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br/>

  So that he three of them tormented thus.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01664">To him in front the biting was as naught<br/>

  Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br/>

  Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01665">"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"<br/>

  The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;<br/>

  With head inside, he plies his legs without.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01666">Of the two others, who head downward are,<br/>

  The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br/>

  See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01667">And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br/>

  But night is reascending, and 'tis time<br/>

  That we depart, for we have seen the whole."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01668">As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br/>

  And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br/>

  And when the wings were opened wide apart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01669">He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br/>

  From fell to fell descended downward then<br/>

  Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01670">When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br/>

  Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br/>

  The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01671">Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br/>

  And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br/>

  So that to Hell I thought we were returning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01672">"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"<br/>

  The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br/>

  "Must we perforce depart from so much evil."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01673">Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br/>

  And down upon the margin seated me;<br/>

  Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01674">I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br/>

  Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br/>

  And I beheld him upward hold his legs.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01675">And if I then became disquieted,<br/>

  Let stolid people think who do not see<br/>

  What the point is beyond which I had passed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01676">"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;<br/>

  The way is long, and difficult the road,<br/>

  And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01677">It was not any palace corridor<br/>

  There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br/>

  With floor uneven and unease of light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01678">"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br/>

  My Master," said I when I had arisen,<br/>

  "To draw me from an error speak a little;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01679">Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br/>

  Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br/>

  From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01680">And he to me: "Thou still imaginest<br/>

  Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br/>

  The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01681">That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br/>

  When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br/>

  To which things heavy draw from every side,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01682">And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br/>

  Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br/>

  Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01683">The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br/>

  Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br/>

  Which makes the other face of the Judecca.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01684">Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br/>

  And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br/>

  Still fixed remaineth as he was before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01685">Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br/>

  And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br/>

  For fear of him made of the sea a veil,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01686">And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br/>

  To flee from him, what on this side appears<br/>

  Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01687">A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br/>

  As far receding as the tomb extends,<br/>

  Which not by sight is known, but by the sound<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01688">Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br/>

  Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br/>

  With course that winds about and slightly falls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01689">The Guide and I into that hidden road<br/>

  Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br/>

  And without care of having any rest<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01690">We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01702">To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/>

  Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/>

  Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.<br/>

<p id="id01703">Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/>

  O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/>

<p id="id01704">When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/>

  Turning a little to the other pole,<br/>

<p id="id01705">I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/>

  Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/>

  That more owes not to father any son.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01706">A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/>

  He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/>

  Of which a double list fell on his breast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01707">The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/>

  Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/>

  That him I saw as were the sun before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01708">"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/>

  Have fled away from the eternal prison?"<br/>

  Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01709">"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/>

  In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/>

  That ever black makes the infernal valley?<br/>

  Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/>

  That being damned ye come unto my crags?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01711">Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/>

  And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/>

  Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01712">Then answered him: "I came not of myself;<br/>

  A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/>

  I aided this one with my company.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01713">But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/>

  Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/>

  Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01714">This one has never his last evening seen,<br/>

  But by his folly was so near to it<br/>

  That very little time was there to turn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01715">As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/>

  To rescue him, and other way was none<br/>

  Than this to which I have myself betaken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01716">I've shown him all the people of perdition,<br/>

  And now those spirits I intend to show<br/>

  Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01717">How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/>

  Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/>

  To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01718">Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/>

  He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/>

  As knoweth he who life for her refuses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01719">Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/>

  O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/>

  For her love, then, incline thyself to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01722">Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/>

  I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/>

  If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01723">"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/>

  While I was on the other side," then said he,<br/>

  "That every grace she wished of me I granted;<br/>

<p id="id01724">Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/>

  As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/>

  Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01726">Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/>

  With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/>

  So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01727">For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast<br/>

  By any mist should go before the first<br/>

  The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/>

  To take the mount by easier ascent."<br/>

<p id="id01731">With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/>

  Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/>

  Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01732">And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;<br/>

  Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/>

  The plain unto its lower boundaries."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01733">The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/>

<p id="id01737">Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/>

  There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/>

  That hue which Hell had covered up in me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01738">Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/>

  Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/>

  Any that afterward had known return.<br/>

  While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/>

<p id="id01751">He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/>

  The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/>

  So that near by the eye could not endure him,<br/>

<p id="id01755">But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/>

  With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/>

<p id="id01878">His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/>

  Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02042">One just above us came to take his station,<br/>

  And one descended to the opposite bank,<br/>

  So that the people were contained between them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02043">Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;<br/>

  But in their faces was the eye bewildered,<br/>

  As faculty confounded by excess.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02044">"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,"<br/>

  Sordello said, "as guardians of the valley<br/>

  Against the serpent, that will come anon."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02045">Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,<br/>

  Turned round about, and closely drew myself,<br/>

  Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02046">And once again Sordello: "Now descend we<br/>

  'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;<br/>

  Right pleasant will it be for them to see you."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02047">Only three steps I think that I descended,<br/>

  And was below, and saw one who was looking<br/>

  Only at me, as if he fain would know me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02048">Already now the air was growing dark,<br/>

  But not so that between his eyes and mine<br/>

  It did not show what it before locked up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02049">Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;<br/>

  Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<br/>

  When I beheld thee not among the damned!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02050">No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;<br/>

  Then asked he: "How long is it since thou camest<br/>

  O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02051">"Oh!" said I to him, "through the dismal places<br/>

  I came this morn; and am in the first life,<br/>

  Albeit the other, going thus, I gain."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02052">And on the instant my reply was heard,<br/>

  He and Sordello both shrank back from me,<br/>

  Like people who are suddenly bewildered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02053">One to Virgilius, and the other turned<br/>

  To one who sat there, crying, "Up, Currado!<br/>

  Come and behold what God in grace has willed!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02054">Then, turned to me: "By that especial grace<br/>

  Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals<br/>

  His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02055">When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,<br/>

  Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<br/>

  Where answer to the innocent is made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02056">I do not think her mother loves me more,<br/>

  Since she has laid aside her wimple white,<br/>

  Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02057">Through her full easily is comprehended<br/>

  How long in woman lasts the fire of love,<br/>

  If eye or touch do not relight it often.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02058">So fair a hatchment will not make for her<br/>

  The Viper marshalling the Milanese<br/>

  A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02059">In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed<br/>

  Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal<br/>

  Which measurably burneth in the heart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02060">My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,<br/>

  Still to that point where slowest are the stars,<br/>

  Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02061">And my Conductor: "Son, what dost thou gaze at<br/>

  Up there?"  And I to him: "At those three torches<br/>

  With which this hither pole is all on fire."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02062">And he to me: "The four resplendent stars<br/>

  Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,<br/>

  And these have mounted up to where those were."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02063">As he was speaking, to himself Sordello<br/>

  Drew him, and said, "Lo there our Adversary!"<br/>

  And pointed with his finger to look thither.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02064">Upon the side on which the little valley<br/>

  No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance<br/>

  The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02065">'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<br/>

  Turning at times its head about, and licking<br/>

  Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02066">I did not see, and therefore cannot say<br/>

  How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,<br/>

  But well I saw that they were both in motion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02067">Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,<br/>

  The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,<br/>

  Up to their stations flying back alike.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02068">The shade that to the Judge had near approached<br/>

  When he had called, throughout that whole assault<br/>

  Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02069">"So may the light that leadeth thee on high<br/>

  Find in thine own free-will as much of wax<br/>

  My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br/>

  I fortify it, marvel not thereat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02104">Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br/>

  That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br/>

  Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02105">I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br/>

  Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br/>

  And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02106">And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br/>

  I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br/>

  Such in the face that I endured it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02107">And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br/>

  Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02109">"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,"<br/>

  My Master answered him, "but even now<br/>

<p id="id02110">"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,"<br/>

  Again began the courteous janitor;<br/>

  "Come forward then unto these stairs of ours."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02111">Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br/>

  Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br/>

  I mirrored myself therein as I appear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02112">The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br/>

  Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br/>

  Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02113">The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br/>

  Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02114">Both of his feet was holding upon this<br/>

  The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02115">Along the three stairs upward with good will<br/>

  Did my Conductor draw me, saying: "Ask<br/>

  Humbly that he the fastening may undo."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02116">Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br/>

  For mercy's sake besought that he would open,<br/>

  But first upon my breast three times I smote.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02117">Seven P's upon my forehead he described<br/>

  With the sword's point, and, "Take heed that thou wash<br/>

  These wounds, when thou shalt be within," he said.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02118">Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br/>

  Of the same colour were with his attire,<br/>

  And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02119">One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br/>

  First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br/>

  Plied he the door, so that I was content.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02120">"Whenever faileth either of these keys<br/>

  So that it turn not rightly in the lock,"<br/>

  He said to us, "this entrance doth not open.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02121">More precious one is, but the other needs<br/>

  More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br/>

  For it is that which doth the knot unloose.<br/>

<p id="id02126">At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br/>

  And "Te Deum laudamus" seemed to hear<br/>

  In voices mingled with sweet melody.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02127">Exactly such an image rendered me<br/>

  That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br/>

<p id="id02256">Towards us came the being beautiful<br/>

<p id="id02258">At this announcement few are they who come!<br/>

  O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br/>

<p id="id02259">He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/>

  There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/>

  Then a safe passage promised unto me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02260">As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/>

  Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/>

  O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02261">The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/>

  By stairways that were made there in the age<br/>

  When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02262">E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/>

  Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/>

  But on this, side and that the high rock graze.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02263">As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/>

  "Beati pauperes spiritu," voices<br/>

  Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02264">Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/>

  From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/>

  One enters, and below with wild laments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02265">We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/>

  And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/>

  Than on the plain it had appeared before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02266">Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/>

  Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/>

  Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02267">He answered: "When the P's which have remained<br/>

  Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/>

  Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02268">Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/>

  That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/>

  But urging up will be to them delight."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02269">Then did I even as they do who are going<br/>

  With something on the head to them unknown,<br/>

  Unless the signs of others make them doubt,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02270">Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/>

  And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/>

  Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02271">And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/>

  I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/>

  Upon my temples he who bore the keys;<br/>

<p id="id02273" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
<p id="id02274" style="margin-top: 2em">We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/>

<p id="id02275">There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/>

<p id="id02278">Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/>

  Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/>

  And turned the left part of himself about.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02279">"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/>

  Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"<br/>

  Said he, "as one within here should be led.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02280">Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/>

  If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/>

  Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02281">As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/>

  So much already there had we advanced<br/>

  In little time, by dint of ready will;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02282">And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/>

  They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/>

  Unto Love's table courteous invitations,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02283">The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/>

  "Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,<br/>

  And went reiterating it behind us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02284">And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/>

  Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/>

  "I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02285">"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"<br/>

  And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/>

  Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02286">And the good Master said: "This circle scourges<br/>

  The sin of envy, and on that account<br/>

  Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02287">The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/>

  I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/>

  Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02288">But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/>

  And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/>

  And each one close against the cliff is seated."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02289">Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/>

  I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/>

  Not from the colour of the stone diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02290">And when we were a little farther onward,<br/>

  I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"<br/>

  A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02291">I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/>

  A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/>

  With pity at what afterward I saw.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02292">For when I had approached so near to them<br/>

  That manifest to me their acts became,<br/>

  Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02293">Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/>

  And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/>

  And all of them were by the bank sustained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02294">Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/>

  Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/>

  And one upon another leans his head,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02295">So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/>

  Not only at the accent of their words,<br/>

  But at their aspect, which no less implores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02296">And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/>

  So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/>

  Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02297">For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/>

  And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02298">To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/>

  Seeing the others without being seen;<br/>

  Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02299">Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/>

  And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/>

  But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02300">I had Virgilius upon that side<br/>

  Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/>

  Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;<br/>

<p id="id02301">Upon the other side of me I had<br/>

  The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/>

  Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02302">To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"<br/>

  Began I, "of beholding the high light,<br/>

<p id="id02306">By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/>

  A little farther on than where I stood,<br/>

  Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02307">Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/>

  In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/>

  Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02308">"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,<br/>

  If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/>

  Make thyself known to me by place or name."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02309">"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with<br/>

  The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/>

  Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02310">Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/>

<p id="id02312">My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/>

  Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/>

  A joy received unequalled by all others;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02314">So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/>

  Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'<br/>

<p id="id02315">Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/>

<p id="id02317">But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/>

  Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/>

  As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02318">"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,<br/>

<p id="id02319">Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/>

  My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/>

  For even now the load down there weighs on me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02320">And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us<br/>

  Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"<br/>

  And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02321">And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/>

  Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/>

  O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02322">"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"<br/>

  She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/>

  Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02323">And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/>

  If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/>

  Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02324">Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/>

<p id="id02380">So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br/>

  Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br/>

  There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02381">And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br/>

  Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br/>

  That straight towards the west we now were going<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02382">When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br/>

  Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br/>

  And stupor were to me the things unknown,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02383">Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br/>

<p id="id02384">As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br/>

<p id="id02386">So it appeared to me that by a light<br/>

  Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br/>

  On which account my sight was swift to flee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02387">"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br/>

  So fully screen my sight that it avail me,"<br/>

<p id="id02392">My Master and myself, we two alone<br/>

  Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br/>

  Some profit to acquire from words of his;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02393">And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br/>

  "What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br/>

<p id="id02394">Whence he to me: "Of his own greatest failing<br/>

<p id="id02396">But if the love of the supernal sphere<br/>

  Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br/>

  There would not be that fear within your breast;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02397">For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'<br/>

  So much the more of good each one possesses,<br/>

  And more of charity in that cloister burns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02398">"I am more hungering to be satisfied,"<br/>

  I said, "than if I had before been silent,<br/>

  And more of doubt within my mind I gather.<br/>

<p id="id02399">How can it be, that boon distributed<br/>

  The more possessors can more wealthy make<br/>

  Therein, than if by few it be possessed?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02400">And he to me: "Because thou fixest still<br/>

  Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/>

  Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.<br/>

<p id="id02401">That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/>

  Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/>

  As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02402">So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/>

  So that as far as charity extends,<br/>

  O'er it increases the eternal valour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02403">And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/>

  More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/>

  And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02404">And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/>

  Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/>

  As are the two already, the five wounds<br/>

  That close themselves again by being painful."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02406">Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"<br/>

  I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/>

  So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02407">There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/>

  Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/>

  And in a temple many persons saw;<br/>

<p id="id02409">Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/>

  Were seeking for thee;"—and as here she ceased,<br/>

  That which appeared at first had disappeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02410">Then I beheld another with those waters<br/>

  Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/>

<p id="id02412">Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/>

  That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02413">To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/>

  "What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/>

  If he who loves us be by us condemned?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02414">Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/>

  With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/>

  Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02415">And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/>

  That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/>

  But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02416">Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/>

  That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/>

  With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02417">Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/>

  To things external to it which are true,<br/>

  Did I my not false errors recognize.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02418">My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/>

  Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/>

  Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02419">But hast been coming more than half a league<br/>

  Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/>

  In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02420">"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/>

  I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,<br/>

  When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02421">And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02422">What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/>

  To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/>

  Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02423">I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does<br/>

<p id="id02424">But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/>

  Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/>

  To use their wakefulness when it returns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02425">We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/>

  Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/>

  Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02426">And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/>

  In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/>

<p id="id02437">"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/>

<p id="id02440">"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"<br/>

  He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/>

  Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02441">Thereon began I: "With that swathing band<br/>

  Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/>

  And hither came I through the infernal anguish.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02442">And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/>

  So that he wills that I behold his court<br/>

  By method wholly out of modern usage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02443">Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/>

  But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br/>

  Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02444">"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br/>

  The world I knew, and loved that excellence,<br/>

  At which has each one now unbent his bow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02445">For mounting upward, thou art going right."<br/>

  Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee<br/>

  To pray for me when thou shalt be above."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02446">And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee<br/>

  To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br/>

  Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02447">First it was simple, and is now made double<br/>

  By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br/>

  Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02448">The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br/>

  By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br/>

  And with iniquity is big and covered;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02449">But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br/>

  That I may see it, and to others show it;<br/>

  For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02450">A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br/>

  He first sent forth, and then began he: "Brother,<br/>

  The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02451">Ye who are living every cause refer<br/>

  Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/>

  They of necessity moved with themselves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02452">If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/>

  Free will, nor any justice would there be<br/>

  In having joy for good, or grief for evil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02453">The heavens your movements do initiate,<br/>

  I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br/>

  Light has been given you for good and evil,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02454">And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br/>

  In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/>

  Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02455">To greater force and to a better nature,<br/>

  Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/>

  The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02456">Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/>

  In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/>

  And I therein will now be thy true spy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02457">Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br/>

  Before it is, like to a little girl<br/>

  Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02458">Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,<br/>

  Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,<br/>

  Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02459">Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/>

  Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/>

  If guide or rein turn not aside its love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02460">Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/>

  Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/>

  Of the true city should discern the tower.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02461">The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/>

  No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/>

  Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02462">Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/>

  Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br/>

  Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02463">Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br/>

  The cause is that has made the world depraved,<br/>

  And not that nature is corrupt in you.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02464">Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was<br/>

  Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<br/>

  Of God and of the world, made manifest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02465">One has the other quenched, and to the crosier<br/>

  The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br/>

  That by main force one with the other go,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02466">Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br/>

  If thou believe not, think upon the grain,<br/>

  For by its seed each herb is recognized.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02467">In the land laved by Po and Adige,<br/>

  Valour and courtesy used to be found,<br/>

  Before that Frederick had his controversy;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02468">Now in security can pass that way<br/>

  Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,<br/>

  From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02469">True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids<br/>

  The ancient age the new, and late they deem it<br/>

  That God restore them to the better life:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02470">Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<br/>

  And Guido da Castel, who better named is,<br/>

  In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02471">Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,<br/>

  Confounding in itself two governments,<br/>

  Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02472">"O Marco mine," I said, "thou reasonest well;<br/>

  And now discern I why the sons of Levi<br/>

  Have been excluded from the heritage.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02473">But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample<br/>

  Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained<br/>

  In reprobation of the barbarous age?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02474">"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,"<br/>

  He answered me; "for speaking Tuscan to me,<br/>

  It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02475">By other surname do I know him not,<br/>

  Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<br/>

  May God be with you, for I come no farther.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02476">Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,<br/>

  Already whitening; and I must depart—<br/>

  Yonder the Angel is—ere he appear."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02477">Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p>
<p id="id02478" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVII</p>
<p id="id02479" style="margin-top: 2em">Remember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps<br/>

  A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<br/>

  Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02480">How, when the vapours humid and condensed<br/>

  Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere<br/>

  Of the sun feebly enters in among them,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02481">And thy imagination will be swift<br/>

  In coming to perceive how I re-saw<br/>

  The sun at first, that was already setting.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02482">Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master<br/>

  Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud<br/>

  To rays already dead on the low shores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02483">O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us<br/>

  So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,<br/>

  Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02484">Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?<br/>

  Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,<br/>

  By self, or by a will that downward guides it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02485">Of her impiety, who changed her form<br/>

  Into the bird that most delights in singing,<br/>

  In my imagining appeared the trace;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02486">And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn<br/>

  Within itself, that from without there came<br/>

  Nothing that then might be received by it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02487">Then reigned within my lofty fantasy<br/>

  One crucified, disdainful and ferocious<br/>

  In countenance, and even thus was dying.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02488">Around him were the great Ahasuerus,<br/>

  Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,<br/>

  Who was in word and action so entire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02489">And even as this image burst asunder<br/>

  Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br/>

  In which the water it was made of fails,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02490">There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br/>

  Bitterly weeping, and she said: "O queen,<br/>

  Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02491">Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br/>

  Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br/>

  Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02492">As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br/>

  New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br/>

  And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02493">So this imagining of mine fell down<br/>

  As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br/>

  Greater by far than what is in our wont.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02494">I turned me round to see where I might be,<br/>

  When said a voice, "Here is the passage up;"<br/>

  Which from all other purposes removed me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02495">And made my wish so full of eagerness<br/>

  To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br/>

  It never rests till meeting face to face;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02496">But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br/>

  And in its own excess its figure veils,<br/>

  Even so my power was insufficient here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02497">"This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br/>

  Of going up directs us without asking,<br/>

  And who with his own light himself conceals.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02498">He does with us as man doth with himself;<br/>

  For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br/>

  Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02499">Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br/>

  Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br/>

  For then we could not till the day return."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02500">Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br/>

  Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br/>

  And I, as soon as the first step I reached,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02501">Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br/>

  And fanning in the face, and saying, "'Beati<br/>

  Pacifici,' who are without ill anger."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02502">Already over us were so uplifted<br/>

  The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br/>

  That upon many sides the stars appeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02503">"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?"<br/>

  I said within myself; for I perceived<br/>

  The vigour of my legs was put in truce.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02504">We at the point were where no more ascends<br/>

  The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br/>

  Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02505">And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br/>

  Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br/>

  Then to my Master turned me round and said:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02506">"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br/>

  Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br/>

  Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02507">And he to me: "The love of good, remiss<br/>

  In what it should have done, is here restored;<br/>

  Here plied again the ill-belated oar;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02508">But still more openly to understand,<br/>

  Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/>

  Some profitable fruit from our delay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02509">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/>

  Son," he began, "was destitute of love<br/>

  Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02510">The natural was ever without error;<br/>

  But err the other may by evil object,<br/>

  Or by too much, or by too little vigour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02511">While in the first it well directed is,<br/>

  And in the second moderates itself,<br/>

  It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02512">But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/>

  Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/>

  'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02513">Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/>

  The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br/>

  And every act that merits punishment.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02514">Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/>

  Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/>

  From their own hatred all things are secure;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02515">And since we cannot think of any being<br/>

  Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/>

  Of hating Him is all desire cut off.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02516">Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/>

  The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,<br/>

  And this is born in three modes in your clay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02517">There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br/>

  Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br/>

  That from his greatness he may be cast down;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02518">There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br/>

  Fear they may lose because another rises,<br/>

  Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02519">And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br/>

  So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br/>

  And such must needs shape out another's harm.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02520">This threefold love is wept for down below;<br/>

  Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br/>

  That runneth after good with measure faulty.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02521">Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/>

  Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/>

  Therefore to overtake it each one strives.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02522">If languid love to look on this attract you,<br/>

  Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br/>

  After just penitence, torments you for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02523">There's other good that does not make man happy;<br/>

  'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good<br/>

  Essence, of every good the fruit and root.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02524">The love that yields itself too much to this<br/>

  Above us is lamented in three circles;<br/>

  But how tripartite it may be described,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02525">I say not, that thou seek it for thyself."</p>
<p id="id02526" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVIII</p>

  Without was mute, and said within: "Perchance<br/>

  The too much questioning I make annoys him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02529">But that true Father, who had comprehended<br/>

  The timid wish, that opened not itself,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02533">The soul, which is created apt to love,<br/>

  Is mobile unto everything that pleases,<br/>

  Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02534">Your apprehension from some real thing<br/>

  An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br/>

  So that it makes the soul turn unto it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02535">And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br/>

  Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br/>

  Which is by pleasure bound in you anew<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02536">Then even as the fire doth upward move<br/>

  By its own form, which to ascend is born,<br/>

  Where longest in its matter it endures,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02537">So comes the captive soul into desire,<br/>

  The truth is from those people, who aver<br/>

  All love is in itself a laudable thing;<br/>

<p id="id02539">Because its matter may perchance appear<br/>

  Aye to be good; but yet not each impression<br/>

  Is good, albeit good may be the wax."<br/>

  Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<br/>

<p id="id02559">Full soon they were upon us, because running<br/>

  Moved onward all that mighty multitude,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02561">"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost<br/>

  By little love!" forthwith the others cried,<br/>

  "For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!"<br/>

<p id="id02562">"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now<br/>

<p id="id02564">These were the words of him who was my Guide;<br/>

  And some one of those spirits said: "Come on<br/>

<p id="id02715">I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br/>

  Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br/>

  Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02716">And, "As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02720">This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02722">Already he was stooping to embrace<br/>

  My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: "Brother,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02723">And he uprising: "Now canst thou the sum<br/>

<p id="id02786">Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02791">I still was wondering what so famished them,<br/>

  For the occasion not yet manifest<br/>

  Of their emaciation and sad squalor;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02792">And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br/>

  His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br/>

  Then cried aloud: "What grace to me is this?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02793">Never should I have known him by his look;<br/>

  But in his voice was evident to me<br/>

  That which his aspect had suppressed within it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02794">This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br/>

  My recognition of his altered face,<br/>

  And I recalled the features of Forese.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02795">"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,"<br/>

  Entreated he, "which doth my skin discolour,<br/>

  Nor at default of flesh that I may have;<br/>

<p id="id02796">But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br/>

  Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br/>

  Do not delay in speaking unto me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02797">"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br/>

  I answered him, "beholding it so changed!<br/>

<p id="id02841">But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/>

  Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/>

  'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02842">And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever<br/>

  Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/>

  Which he within me dictates, singing go."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02843">"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot<br/>

  Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/>

  Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02844">I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/>

  Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/>

  Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02845">And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/>

  No difference sees from one style to another;"<br/>

  And as if satisfied, he held his peace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02846">Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,<br/>

  Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/>

  Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02847">In such wise all the people who were there,<br/>

  Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/>

  Both by their leanness and their wishes light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02848">And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/>

  Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/>

  Until he vents the panting of his chest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02849">So did Forese let the holy flock<br/>

  Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/>

  "When will it be that I again shall see thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02850">"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;<br/>

  Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/>

  But I shall sooner in desire arrive;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02851">Because the place where I was set to live<br/>

  From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/>

  And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02852">"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it<br/>

  At a beast's tail behold I dragged along<br/>

  Towards the valley where is no repentance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02853">Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/>

  Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/>

  And leaves the body vilely mutilated.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02854">Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted<br/>

  His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee<br/>

  That which my speech no farther can declare.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02855">Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/>

  Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/>

  By coming onward thus abreast with thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02856">As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/>

  A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/>

  And seeks the honour of the first encounter,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02857">So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/>

  And on the road remained I with those two,<br/>

  Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02858">And when before us he had gone so far<br/>

  Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/>

  As was my understanding to his words,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02859">Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/>

  Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/>

  From having but just then turned thitherward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02860">People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/>

  And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/>

  Like little children eager and deluded,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02861">Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/>

  But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/>

  Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02862">Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/>

  And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/>

  Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02863">"Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/>

  The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/>

  And out of that one has this tree been raised."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02864">Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/>

  Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/>

  Went crowding forward on the side that rises.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02865">"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones<br/>

  Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/>

  Combated Theseus with their double breasts;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02866">And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/>

  Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/>

  When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02867">Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/>

  On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/>

  Followed forsooth by miserable gains;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02868">Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/>

  A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/>

  In contemplation, each without a word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02869">"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"<br/>

  Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/>

  As terrified and timid beasts are wont.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02870">I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/>

  And never in a furnace was there seen<br/>

  Metals or glass so lucent and so red<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02871">As one I saw who said: "If it may please you<br/>

  To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/>

  This way goes he who goeth after peace."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02872">His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/>

  So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/>

  Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02873">And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/>

  The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/>

  Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02874">So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/>

  My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/>

  That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02875">And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace<br/>

  So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/>

  Excites not in their breasts too great desire,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02876">Hungering at all times so far as is just."</p>

<p id="id02878" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br/>

  But goes his way, whate'er to him appear,<br/>

  I cannot and I will not hide me from you.<br/>

I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;<br/>

<p id="id02978" style="margin-top: 2em">As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br/>

  In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br/>

  (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,<br/>

<p id="id02979">And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br/>

  So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br/>

  When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02980">Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br/>

  And chanted forth, "Beati mundo corde,"<br/>

  In voice by far more living than our own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02981">Then: "No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02984">Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br/>

  And unto me Virgilius said: "My son,<br/>

<p id="id02985">Remember thee, remember! and if I<br/>

  On Geryon have safely guided thee,<br/>

<p id="id02986">Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full<br/>

  And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02989">Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br/>

  Somewhat disturbed he said: "Now look thou, Son,<br/>

  'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02990">As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br/>

  The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02991">Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br/>

  I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br/>

  That in my memory evermore is welling.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02992">Whereat he wagged his head, and said: "How now?<br/>

  Shall we stay on this side?" then smiled as one<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02993">Then into the fire in front of me he entered,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02994">When I was in it, into molten glass<br/>

  I would have cast me to refresh myself,<br/>

  So without measure was the burning there!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02995">And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br/>

<p id="id02996">A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br/>

<p id="id02998">"The sun departs," it added, "and night cometh;<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02999">Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br/>

  In such a way that I cut off the rays<br/>

  Before me of the sun, that now was low.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03000">And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br/>

  The horizon of one aspect had become,<br/>

  And Night her boundless dispensation held,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03002">Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br/>

  Because the nature of the mount took from us<br/>

  The power of climbing, more than the delight.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03003">Even as in ruminating passive grow<br/>

  The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br/>

  Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03004">Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br/>

  Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br/>

  Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03005">And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br/>

  Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br/>

  Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03006">Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br/>

  I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br/>

  Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03007">Little could there be seen of things without;<br/>

  But through that little I beheld the stars<br/>

  More luminous and larger than their wont.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03008">Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br/>

  Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes<br/>

  Before a deed is done has tidings of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03009">It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br/>

  First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br/>

  Who with the fire of love seems always burning;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03010">Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br/>

  I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br/>

  Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:<br/>

<p id="id03011">"Know whosoever may my name demand<br/>

  That I am Leah, and go moving round<br/>

  My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03012">To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br/>

  But never does my sister Rachel leave<br/>

  Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03013">To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br/>

  As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br/>

  Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03014">And now before the antelucan splendours<br/>

  That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br/>

  As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03015">The darkness fled away on every side,<br/>

  And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br/>

  Seeing already the great Masters risen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03016">"That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br/>

  The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br/>

  To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03017">Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br/>

  As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03018">Such longing upon longing came upon me<br/>

  To be above, that at each step thereafter<br/>

<p id="id03019">When underneath us was the stairway all<br/>

  Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,<br/>

  Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,<br/>

<p id="id03022">Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br/>

  Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br/>

  Which of itself alone this land produces.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03023">Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/>

  Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br/>

  Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03024">Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br/>

  Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br/>

  And error were it not to do its bidding;<br/>

<p id="id03028">Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/>

  Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/>

  Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03029">A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/>

  No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,<br/>

  Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03031">Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/>

<p id="id03034">Already my slow steps had carried me<br/>

  Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/>

  Could not perceive where I had entered it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03035">And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/>

  Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/>

  Through very wonder every other thought)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03040">A lady all alone, who went along<br/>

  Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/>

<p id="id03041">"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/>

  Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03042">May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/>

  Near to this river's bank," I said to her,<br/>

  "So much that I might hear what thou art singing.<br/>

<p id="id03043">Thou makest me remember where and what<br/>

  Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/>

  Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03044">As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/>

  And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/>

  And hardly puts one foot before the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03045">On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/>

  She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/>

  Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03046">And my entreaties made to be content,<br/>

  So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03047">As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/>

  Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/>

  To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03048">I do not think there shone so great a light<br/>

  Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/>

  By her own son, beyond his usual custom!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03049">Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03053">Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/>

  Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/>

<p id="id03055">"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,<br/>

  Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/>

  One to avoid and one to see the sun,<br/>

<p id="id03080">She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/>

  Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/>

<p id="id03086">For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/>

  The woman only, and but just created,<br/>

  Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;<br/>

  Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/>

  The others took their step, or slow or swift.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03121">Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/>

<p id="id03158">Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/>

  Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"<br/>

  But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.<br/>

<p id="id03159">Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/>

<p id="id03162">But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/>

  Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/>

  "O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03163">The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03164">She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/>

<p id="id03167">Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/>

  That destine every seed unto some end,<br/>

  According as the stars are in conjunction,<br/>

  Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/>

  That near to them our sight approaches not,<br/>

<p id="id03169">Such had this man become in his new life<br/>

  Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/>

  Would have made admirable proof in him;<br/>

<p id="id03170">But so much more malignant and more savage<br/>

  Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/>

  The more good earthly vigour it possesses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03171">Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/>

  Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/>

  I led him with me turned in the right way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03172">As soon as ever of my second age<br/>

  I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/>

  And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/>

  I was to him less dear and less delightful;<br/>

<p id="id03174">And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/>

  Pursuing the false images of good,<br/>

  That never any promises fulfil;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03175">Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/>

  By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/>

  I called him back, so little did he heed them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03176">So low he fell, that all appliances<br/>

  For his salvation were already short,<br/>

  Save showing him the people of perdition.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03177">For this I visited the gates of death,<br/>

  And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/>

  My intercessions were with weeping borne.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03178">God's lofty fiat would be violated,<br/>

  If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/>

  Should tasted be, withouten any scot<br/>

<p id="id03181" style="margin-top: 2em">"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"<br/>

  Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/>

  That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03182">She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/>

  "Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/>

  Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03183">My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/>

  That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/>

  Than by its organs it was set at large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03184">Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?<br/>

  Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/>

  In thee not yet are by the waters injured."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03185">Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/>

  Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/>

  Was needful to the understanding of it.<br/>

<p id="id03186">Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged<br/>

  Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/>

  And with less force the arrow hits the mark,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03187">So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/>

  Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/>

  And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03188">Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine<br/>

  Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/>

  Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03189">What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/>

  Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/>

  Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03190">And what allurements or what vantages<br/>

  Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/>

  That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03191">After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/>

  Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/>

  And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03192">Weeping I said: "The things that present were<br/>

  With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/>

  Soon as your countenance concealed itself."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03193">And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/>

  What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/>

  Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03194">But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/>

  The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/>

  Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03195">But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/>

  For thy transgression, and another time<br/>

  Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03196">Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/>

  So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/>

  My buried flesh should have directed thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03197">Never to thee presented art or nature<br/>

  Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/>

  I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03198">And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/>

  By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/>

  Should then have drawn thee into its desire?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03199">Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/>

  Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/>

  To follow me, who was no longer such.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03200">Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/>

  Or other vanity of such brief use.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03201">The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/>

  But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03202">Even as children silent in their shame<br/>

  Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/>

  And conscious of their fault, and penitent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03203">So was I standing; and she said: "If thou<br/>

  In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/>

  And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/>

  Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03206">And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/>

  Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/>

  Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03207">And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/>

  Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/>

  That is one person only in two natures.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03208">Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/>

  She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/>

  To excel, than others here, when she was here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03209">So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/>

  That of all other things the one which turned me<br/>

  Most to its love became the most my foe.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03210">Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/>

  "Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,<br/>

  Remember it I cannot, much less write it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03214">The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03215">Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/>

  Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/>

<p id="id03218">Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/>

<p id="id03220">A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/>

<p id="id03243">I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!"<br/>

  Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br/>

  Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03244">Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br/>

  As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<br/>

  Among their forests marvelled at for height.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03245">"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<br/>

  Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,<br/>

  Since appetite by this was turned to evil."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03246">After this fashion round the tree robust<br/>

  The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br/>

  "Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03247">And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br/>

  He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br/>

  And what was of it unto it left bound.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03248">In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br/>

  Falls the great light, with that together mingled<br/>

  Which after the celestial Lasca shines)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03249">Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,<br/>

  Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun<br/>

  Harness his steeds beneath another star:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03250">Less than of rose and more than violet<br/>

  A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree<br/>

  That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03251">I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br/>

  The hymn which afterward that people sang,<br/>

  Nor did I bear the melody throughout.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03252">Had I the power to paint how fell asleep<br/>

  Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<br/>

  Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03253">Even as a painter who from model paints<br/>

  I would portray how I was lulled asleep;<br/>

  He may, who well can picture drowsihood.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03254">Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,<br/>

  And say a splendour rent from me the veil<br/>

  Of slumber, and a calling: "Rise, what dost thou?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03255">As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br/>

  Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br/>

  And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03256">Peter and John and James conducted were,<br/>

  And, overcome, recovered at the word<br/>

  By which still greater slumbers have been broken,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03257">And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/>

  Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/>

  And the apparel of their Master changed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03258">So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/>

  Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/>

  Aforetime of my steps beside the river,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03259">And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"<br/>

  And she: "Behold her seated underneath<br/>

  The leafage new, upon the root of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03260">Behold the company that circles her;<br/>

  The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/>

  With more melodious song, and more profound."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03261">And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/>

  Because already in my sight was she<br/>

  Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03262">Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/>

  Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/>

  Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03263">Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/>

  The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/>

  Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03264">"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/>

  And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br/>

  A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03265">Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,<br/>

  Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/>

  Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03266">Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/>

  Of her commandments all devoted was,<br/>

  My mind and eyes directed where she willed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03267">Never descended with so swift a motion<br/>

  Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/>

  From out the region which is most remote,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03268">As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/>

  Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/>

  As well as blossoms and the foliage new,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03269">And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/>

  Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/>

  Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03270">Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/>

  Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/>

  That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03271">But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/>

  My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/>

  As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03272">Then by the way that it before had come,<br/>

  Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle<br/>

  Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03273">And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/>

  A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/>

  "My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03274">Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/>

  Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/>

  Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03275">And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/>

  Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/>

  Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03276">That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/>

  A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/>

  Perhaps with pure intention and benign,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03277">Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/>

  The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/>

  A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03278">Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/>

  Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/>

  Three on the pole and one at either corner.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03279">The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/>

  Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/>

  A monster such had never yet been seen!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03280">Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/>

  Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/>

  A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03281">And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/>

  Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/>

  And ever and anon they kissed each other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03282">But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/>

  Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/>

  Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03283">Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/>

  He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/>

  Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03284">A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>
<p id="id03285" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXIII</p>
<p id="id03286" style="margin-top: 2em">"Deus venerunt gentes," alternating<br/>

  Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br/>

  The maidens in the midst of tears began;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03287">And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br/>

  Listened to them with such a countenance,<br/>

  That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03288">But when the other virgins place had given<br/>

  For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br/>

  With colour as of fire, she made response:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03289">"'Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br/>

  Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,<br/>

  'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03290">Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br/>

  And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br/>

  Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03291">So she moved onward; and I do not think<br/>

  That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br/>

  When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03292">And with a tranquil aspect, "Come more quickly,"<br/>

  To me she said, "that, if I speak with thee,<br/>

  To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03293">As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/>

  She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not<br/>

  Venture to question now, in coming with me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03294">As unto those who are too reverential,<br/>

  Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/>

  Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03295">It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/>

  Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,<br/>

  You know, and that which thereunto is good."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03296">And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness<br/>

  Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03297">Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/>

  Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br/>

  So that she seemeth here to contradict me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03516">Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br/>

  That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br/>

  That has been done it was not right to do,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03517">E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br/>

  Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br/>

  Not to lose pity pitiless became.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03518">At this point I desire thee to remember<br/>

  That force with will commingles, and they cause<br/>

  That the offences cannot be excused.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03519">Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br/>

  But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br/>

  If it refrain, to fall into more harm.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03520">Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br/>

  She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br/>

  The other, so that both of us speak truth."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03521">Such was the flowing of the holy river<br/>

  That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br/>

  This put to rest my wishes one and all.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03522">"O love of the first lover, O divine,"<br/>

  Said I forthwith, "whose speech inundates me<br/>

  And warms me so, it more and more revives me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03523">My own affection is not so profound<br/>

  As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br/>

  Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03524">Well I perceive that never sated is<br/>

  Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br/>

  Beyond which nothing true expands itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03525">It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br/>

  When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br/>

  If not, then each desire would frustrate be.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03526">Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br/>

  Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br/>

  Which to the top from height to height impels us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03527">This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br/>

  With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br/>

  Another truth, which is obscure to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03528">I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br/>

  For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br/>

  That in your balance they will not be light."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03529">Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br/>

  Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br/>

  That, overcome my power, I turned my back<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03530">And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p>
<p id="id03531" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto V</p>
<p id="id03532" style="margin-top: 2em">"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br/>

  Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br/>

  So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03533">Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br/>

  From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br/>

  To the good apprehended moves its feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03534">Well I perceive how is already shining<br/>

  Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br/>

  That only seen enkindles always love;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03535">And if some other thing your love seduce,<br/>

  'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br/>

  Ill understood, which there is shining through.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03536">Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br/>

  For broken vow can such return be made<br/>

  As to secure the soul from further claim."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03537">This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br/>

  And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br/>

  Continued thus her holy argument:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03538">"The greatest gift that in his largess God<br/>

  Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br/>

  Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03539">Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br/>

  Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br/>

  Both all and only were and are endowed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03540">Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br/>

  The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br/>

  So that when thou consentest God consents:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03541">For, closing between God and man the compact,<br/>

  A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br/>

  Such as I say, and made by its own act.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03542">What can be rendered then as compensation?<br/>

  Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,<br/>

  With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03543">Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br/>

  But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br/>

  Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03544">Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br/>

  Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br/>

  Requireth further aid for thy digestion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03545">Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br/>

  And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,<br/>

  The having heard without retaining it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03546">In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br/>

  Convene together; and the one is that<br/>

  Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03547">This last for evermore is cancelled not<br/>

  Unless complied with, and concerning this<br/>

  With such precision has above been spoken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03548">Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br/>

  To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br/>

  Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03549">The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br/>

  May well indeed be such that one errs not<br/>

  If it for other matter be exchanged.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03550">But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br/>

  At his arbitrament, without the turning<br/>

  Both of the white and of the yellow key;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03551">And every permutation deem as foolish,<br/>

  If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br/>

  As the four is in six, be not contained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03552">Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br/>

  In value that it drags down every balance,<br/>

  Cannot be satisfied with other spending.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03553">Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br/>

  Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br/>

  As Jephthah was in his first offering,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03554">Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,<br/>

  Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br/>

  Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03555">Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br/>

  And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br/>

  Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03556">Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br/>

  Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br/>

  And think not every water washes you.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03557">Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br/>

  And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br/>

  Let this suffice you unto your salvation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03558">If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br/>

  Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br/>

  So that the Jew among you may not mock you.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03559">Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br/>

  Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple<br/>

  Combats at its own pleasure with itself."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03560">Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br/>

  Then all desireful turned herself again<br/>

  To that part where the world is most alive.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03561">Her silence and her change of countenance<br/>

  Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br/>

  That had already in advance new questions;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03562">And as an arrow that upon the mark<br/>

  Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br/>

  So did we speed into the second realm.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03563">My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br/>

  As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br/>

  More luminous thereat the planet grew;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03564">And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br/>

  What became I, who by my nature am<br/>

  Exceeding mutable in every guise!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03565">As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br/>

  The fishes draw to that which from without<br/>

  Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03566">So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br/>

  Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br/>

  "Lo, this is she who shall increase our love."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03567">And as each one was coming unto us,<br/>

  Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br/>

  By the effulgence clear that issued from it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03568">Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br/>

  No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br/>

  An agonizing need of knowing more;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03569">And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these<br/>

  Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br/>

  As they unto mine eyes were manifest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03570">"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br/>

  To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br/>

  Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03571">With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br/>

  Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br/>

  To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03572">Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br/>

  Was spoken, and by Beatrice: "Speak, speak<br/>

  Securely, and believe them even as Gods."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03573">"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br/>

  In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br/>

  Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03574">But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br/>

  Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br/>

  That veils itself to men in alien rays."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03575">This said I in direction of the light<br/>

  Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br/>

  By far more lucent than it was before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03576">Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br/>

  By too much light, when heat has worn away<br/>

  The tempering influence of the vapours dense,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03577">By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br/>

  In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br/>

  And thus close, close enfolded answered me<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03578">In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p>
<p id="id03579" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto VI</p>

  Pointed me out the way by words of his.<br/>

<p id="id03586">Him I believed, and what was his assertion<br/>

  I now see clearly, even as thou seest<br/>

  Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,<br/>

  Against the other princes and confederates.<br/>

<p id="id03595">Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br/>

  Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br/>

  Received the fame I willingly embalm;<br/>

  Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this<br/>

  Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03798">Never was heart of mortal so disposed<br/>

  To worship, nor to give itself to God<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03799">As at those words did I myself become;<br/>

  And all my love was so absorbed in Him,<br/>

  That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03800">Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it<br/>

  So that the splendour of her laughing eyes<br/>

  My single mind on many things divided.<br/>

<p id="id03801">Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04331">If it were tempered not, is so resplendent<br/>

  That all thy mortal power in its effulgence<br/>

  Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04332">We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,<br/>

  That underneath the burning Lion's breast<br/>

  Now radiates downward mingled with his power.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04333">Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,<br/>

  And make of them a mirror for the figure<br/>

  That in this mirror shall appear to thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04334">He who could know what was the pasturage<br/>

  My sight had in that blessed countenance,<br/>

  When I transferred me to another care,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04335">Would recognize how grateful was to me<br/>

  Obedience unto my celestial escort,<br/>

  By counterpoising one side with the other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04336">Within the crystal which, around the world<br/>

  Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,<br/>

  Under whom every wickedness lay dead,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04337">Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,<br/>

  A stairway I beheld to such a height<br/>

  Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04338">Likewise beheld I down the steps descending<br/>

  So many splendours, that I thought each light<br/>

  That in the heaven appears was there diffused.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04339">And as accordant with their natural custom<br/>

  The rooks together at the break of day<br/>

  Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04340">Then some of them fly off without return,<br/>

  Others come back to where they started from,<br/>

  And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04341">Such fashion it appeared to me was there<br/>

  Within the sparkling that together came,<br/>

  As soon as on a certain step it struck,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04342">And that which nearest unto us remained<br/>

  Became so clear, that in my thought I said,<br/>

  "Well I perceive the love thou showest me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04343">But she, from whom I wait the how and when<br/>

  Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I<br/>

  Against desire do well if I ask not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04344">She thereupon, who saw my silentness<br/>

  In the sight of Him who seeth everything,<br/>

  Said unto me, "Let loose thy warm desire."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04345">And I began: "No merit of my own<br/>

  Renders me worthy of response from thee;<br/>

  But for her sake who granteth me the asking,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04346">Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed<br/>

  In thy beatitude, make known to me<br/>

  The cause which draweth thee so near my side;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04347">And tell me why is silent in this wheel<br/>

  The dulcet symphony of Paradise,<br/>

  That through the rest below sounds so devoutly."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04348">"Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,"<br/>

  It answer made to me; "they sing not here,<br/>

  For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04349">Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps<br/>

  Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br/>

  With words, and with the light that mantles me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04350">Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,<br/>

  For love as much and more up there is burning,<br/>

  As doth the flaming manifest to thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04351">But the high charity, that makes us servants<br/>

  Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br/>

  Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04352">"I see full well," said I, "O sacred lamp!<br/>

  How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br/>

  To follow the eternal Providence;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04353">But this is what seems hard for me to see,<br/>

  Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone<br/>

  Unto this office from among thy consorts."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04354">No sooner had I come to the last word,<br/>

  Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br/>

  Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04355">When answer made the love that was therein:<br/>

  "On me directed is a light divine,<br/>

  Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04356">Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br/>

  Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br/>

  The supreme essence from which this is drawn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04357">Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br/>

  For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br/>

  The clearness of the flame I equal make.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04358">But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br/>

  That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br/>

  Could this demand of thine not satisfy;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04359">Because so deeply sinks in the abyss<br/>

  Of the eternal statute what thou askest,<br/>

  From all created sight it is cut off.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04360">And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,<br/>

  This carry back, that it may not presume<br/>

  Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04361">The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;<br/>

  From this observe how can it do below<br/>

  That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04362">Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br/>

  The question I relinquished, and restricted<br/>

  Myself to ask it humbly who it was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04363">"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<br/>

  And not far distant from thy native place,<br/>

  So high, the thunders far below them sound,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04364">And form a ridge that Catria is called,<br/>

  'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<br/>

  Wont to be dedicate to worship only."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04365">Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br/>

  And then, continuing, it said: "Therein<br/>

  Unto God's service I became so steadfast,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04366">That feeding only on the juice of olives<br/>

  Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br/>

  Contented in my thoughts contemplative.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04367">That cloister used to render to these heavens<br/>

  Abundantly, and now is empty grown,<br/>

  So that perforce it soon must be revealed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04368">I in that place was Peter Damiano;<br/>

  And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<br/>

  Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04369">Little of mortal life remained to me,<br/>

  When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<br/>

  Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04370">Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<br/>

  Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,<br/>

  Taking the food of any hostelry.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04371">Now some one to support them on each side<br/>

  The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,<br/>

  So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04372">They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,<br/>

  So that two beasts go underneath one skin;<br/>

  O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04373">At this voice saw I many little flames<br/>

  From step to step descending and revolving,<br/>

  And every revolution made them fairer.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04374">Round about this one came they and stood still,<br/>

  And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br/>

  It here could find no parallel, nor I<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04375">Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.</p>
<p id="id04376" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXII</p>
<p id="id04377" style="margin-top: 2em">Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<br/>

  Turned like a little child who always runs<br/>

  For refuge there where he confideth most;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04378">And she, even as a mother who straightway<br/>

  Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy<br/>

  With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04379">Said to me: "Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br/>

  And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br/>

  And what is done here cometh from good zeal?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04380">After what wise the singing would have changed thee<br/>

  And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,<br/>

  Since that the cry has startled thee so much,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04381">In which if thou hadst understood its prayers<br/>

  Already would be known to thee the vengeance<br/>

  Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04382">The sword above here smiteth not in haste<br/>

  Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him<br/>

  Who fearing or desiring waits for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04383">But turn thee round towards the others now,<br/>

  For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,<br/>

  If thou thy sight directest as I say."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04384">As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br/>

  And saw a hundred spherules that together<br/>

  With mutual rays each other more embellished.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04385">I stood as one who in himself represses<br/>

  The point of his desire, and ventures not<br/>

  To question, he so feareth the too much.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04386">And now the largest and most luculent<br/>

  Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br/>

  Make my desire concerning it content.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04387">Within it then I heard: "If thou couldst see<br/>

  Even as myself the charity that burns<br/>

  Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04388">But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br/>

  To the high end, I will make answer even<br/>

  Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04389">That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<br/>

  Was frequented of old upon its summit<br/>

  By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04390">And I am he who first up thither bore<br/>

  The name of Him who brought upon the earth<br/>

  The truth that so much sublimateth us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04391">And such abundant grace upon me shone<br/>

  That all the neighbouring towns I drew away<br/>

  From the impious worship that seduced the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04392">These other fires, each one of them, were men<br/>

  Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br/>

  Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04393">Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br/>

  Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br/>

  Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04394">And I to him: "The affection which thou showest<br/>

  Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br/>

  Which I behold and note in all your ardours,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04395">In me have so my confidence dilated<br/>

  As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br/>

  As far unfolded as it hath the power.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04396">Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br/>

  If I may so much grace receive, that I<br/>

  May thee behold with countenance unveiled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04397">He thereupon: "Brother, thy high desire<br/>

  In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br/>

  Where are fulfilled all others and my own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04398">There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br/>

  Every desire; within that one alone<br/>

  Is every part where it has always been;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04399">For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br/>

  And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br/>

  Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04400">Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br/>

  Extending its supernal part, what time<br/>

  So thronged with angels it appeared to him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04401">But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br/>

  His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br/>

  Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04402">The walls that used of old to be an Abbey<br/>

  Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<br/>

  Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04403">But heavy usury is not taken up<br/>

  So much against God's pleasure as that fruit<br/>

  Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04404">For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping<br/>

  Is for the folk that ask it in God's name,<br/>

  Not for one's kindred or for something worse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04405">The flesh of mortals is so very soft,<br/>

  That good beginnings down below suffice not<br/>

  From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04406">Peter began with neither gold nor silver,<br/>

  And I with orison and abstinence,<br/>

  And Francis with humility his convent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04407">And if thou lookest at each one's beginning,<br/>

  And then regardest whither he has run,<br/>

  Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04408">In verity the Jordan backward turned,<br/>

  And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more<br/>

  A wonder to behold, than succour here."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04409">Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew<br/>

  To his own band, and the band closed together;<br/>

  Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04410">The gentle Lady urged me on behind them<br/>

  Up o'er that stairway by a single sign,<br/>

  So did her virtue overcome my nature;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04411">Nor here below, where one goes up and down<br/>

  By natural law, was motion e'er so swift<br/>

  That it could be compared unto my wing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04412">Reader, as I may unto that devout<br/>

  Triumph return, on whose account I often<br/>

  For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04413">Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire<br/>

  And drawn it out again, before I saw<br/>

  The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04414">O glorious stars, O light impregnated<br/>

  With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge<br/>

  All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04415">With you was born, and hid himself with you,<br/>

  He who is father of all mortal life,<br/>

  When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04416">And then when grace was freely given to me<br/>

  To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<br/>

  Your region was allotted unto me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04417">To you devoutly at this hour my soul<br/>

  Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire<br/>

  For the stern pass that draws it to itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04418">"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,"<br/>

  Thus Beatrice began, "thou oughtest now<br/>

  To have thine eves unclouded and acute;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04419">And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,<br/>

  Look down once more, and see how vast a world<br/>

  Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04420">So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,<br/>

  Present itself to the triumphant throng<br/>

  That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04421">I with my sight returned through one and all<br/>

  The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe<br/>

  Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04422">And that opinion I approve as best<br/>

  Which doth account it least; and he who thinks<br/>

  Of something else may truly be called just.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04423">I saw the daughter of Latona shining<br/>

  Without that shadow, which to me was cause<br/>

  That once I had believed her rare and dense.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04424">The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<br/>

  Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves<br/>

  Around and near him Maia and Dione.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04425">Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<br/>

  'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear<br/>

  The change that of their whereabout they make;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04426">And all the seven made manifest to me<br/>

  How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<br/>

  And how they are in distant habitations.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04427">The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<br/>

  To me revolving with the eternal Twins,<br/>

  Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04428">Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</p>
<p id="id04429" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIII</p>
<p id="id04430" style="margin-top: 2em">Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,<br/>

  Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br/>

  Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04431">Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br/>

  And find the food wherewith to nourish them,<br/>

  In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04432">Anticipates the time on open spray<br/>

  And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br/>

  Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04433">Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br/>

  And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br/>

  Underneath which the sun displays less haste;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04434">So that beholding her distraught and wistful,<br/>

  Such I became as he is who desiring<br/>

  For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04435">But brief the space from one When to the other;<br/>

  Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing<br/>

  The welkin grow resplendent more and more.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04436">And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts<br/>

  Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit<br/>

  Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04437">It seemed to me her face was all aflame;<br/>

  And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br/>

  That I must needs pass on without describing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04438">As when in nights serene of the full moon<br/>

  Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br/>

  Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04439">Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br/>

  A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br/>

  E'en as our own doth the supernal sights,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04440">And through the living light transparent shone<br/>

  The lucent substance so intensely clear<br/>

  Into my sight, that I sustained it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04441">O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!<br/>

  To me she said: "What overmasters thee<br/>

  A virtue is from which naught shields itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04442">There are the wisdom and the omnipotence<br/>

  That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,<br/>

  For which there erst had been so long a yearning."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04443">As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,<br/>

  Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br/>

  And down, against its nature, falls to earth,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04444">So did my mind, among those aliments<br/>

  Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br/>

  And that which it became cannot remember.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04445">"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br/>

  Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br/>

  Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04446">I was as one who still retains the feeling<br/>

  Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br/>

  In vain to bring it back into his mind,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04447">When I this invitation heard, deserving<br/>

  Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br/>

  Out of the book that chronicles the past.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04448">If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br/>

  That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br/>

  Most lubrical with their delicious milk,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04449">To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br/>

  It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br/>

  And how the holy aspect it illumed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04450">And therefore, representing Paradise,<br/>

  The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br/>

  Even as a man who finds his way cut off;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04451">But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br/>

  And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br/>

  Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04452">It is no passage for a little boat<br/>

  This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br/>

  Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04453">"Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br/>

  That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br/>

<p id="id04454">There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br/>

  Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br/>

  By whose perfume the good way was discovered."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04455">Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br/>

  Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br/>

  Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04456">As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br/>

  Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br/>

  Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04457">So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br/>

  Illumined from above with burning rays,<br/>

  Beholding not the source of the effulgence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04458">O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br/>

  Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br/>

  There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04459">The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke<br/>

  Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br/>

  My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04460">And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br/>

  The glory and greatness of the living star<br/>

  Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04461">Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br/>

  Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04462">Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br/>

  On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br/>

  Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04463">Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br/>

  Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br/>

  Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04464">"I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br/>

  The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br/>

<p id="id04465">And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br/>

  Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner<br/>

  The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04466">Thus did the circulated melody<br/>

  Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br/>

  Were making to resound the name of Mary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04467">The regal mantle of the volumes all<br/>

  Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br/>

  With breath of God and with his works and ways,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04468">Extended over us its inner border,<br/>

  So very distant, that the semblance of it<br/>

  There where I was not yet appeared to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04469">Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br/>

  Of following the incoronated flame,<br/>

  Which mounted upward near to its own seed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04470">And as a little child, that towards its mother<br/>

  Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br/>

  Through impulse kindled into outward flame,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04471">Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br/>

  So with its summit, that the deep affection<br/>

  They had for Mary was revealed to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04472">Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br/>

  'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness,<br/>

  That ne'er from me has the delight departed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04473">O, what exuberance is garnered up<br/>

  Within those richest coffers, which had been<br/>

  Good husbandmen for sowing here below!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04474">There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br/>

  Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br/>

  Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04475">There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br/>

  Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br/>

  Both with the ancient council and the new,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04476">He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p>
<p id="id04477" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIV</p>
<p id="id04478" style="margin-top: 2em">"O company elect to the great supper<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04481">Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br/>

  Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br/>

  Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04482">And as the wheels in works of horologes<br/>

  Revolve so that the first to the beholder<br/>

  Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04483">So in like manner did those carols, dancing<br/>

  In different measure, of their affluence<br/>

  Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04484">From that one which I noted of most beauty<br/>

  Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<br/>

  That none it left there of a greater brightness;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04485">And around Beatrice three several times<br/>

  It whirled itself with so divine a song,<br/>

  My fantasy repeats it not to me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04486">Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br/>

  Since our imagination for such folds,<br/>

  Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04487">"O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br/>

  With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br/>

  Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04488">Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br/>

  Unto my Lady did direct its breath,<br/>

  Which spake in fashion as I here have said.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04489">And she: "O light eterne of the great man<br/>

  To whom our Lord delivered up the keys<br/>

  He carried down of this miraculous joy,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04490">This one examine on points light and grave,<br/>

  As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith<br/>

  By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04491">If he love well, and hope well, and believe,<br/>

  From thee 'tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<br/>

  There where depicted everything is seen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04492">But since this kingdom has made citizens<br/>

  By means of the true Faith, to glorify it<br/>

  'Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04493">As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not<br/>

  Until the master doth propose the question,<br/>

  To argue it, and not to terminate it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04494">So did I arm myself with every reason,<br/>

  While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br/>

  For such a questioner and such profession.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04495">"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br/>

  What is the Faith?"  Whereat I raised my brow<br/>

  Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04496">Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br/>

  Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br/>

  The water forth from my internal fountain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04497">"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,"<br/>

  Began I, "to the great centurion,<br/>

  Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04498">And I continued: "As the truthful pen,<br/>

  Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br/>

  Who put with thee Rome into the good way,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04499">Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br/>

  And evidence of those that are not seen;<br/>

  And this appears to me its quiddity."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04500">Then heard I: "Very rightly thou perceivest,<br/>

  If well thou understandest why he placed it<br/>

  With substances and then with evidences."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04501">And I thereafterward: "The things profound,<br/>

  That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br/>

  Unto all eyes below are so concealed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04502">That they exist there only in belief,<br/>

  Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br/>

  And hence it takes the nature of a substance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04503">And it behoveth us from this belief<br/>

  To reason without having other sight,<br/>

  And hence it has the nature of evidence."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04504">Then heard I: "If whatever is acquired<br/>

  Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br/>

  No sophist's subtlety would there find place."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04505">Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br/>

  Then added: "Very well has been gone over<br/>

  Already of this coin the alloy and weight;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04506">But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?"<br/>

  And I: "Yes, both so shining and so round<br/>

  That in its stamp there is no peradventure."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04507">Thereafter issued from the light profound<br/>

  That there resplendent was: "This precious jewel,<br/>

  Upon the which is every virtue founded,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04508">Whence hadst thou it?"  And I: "The large outpouring<br/>

  Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br/>

  Upon the ancient parchments and the new,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04509">A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br/>

  With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br/>

  All demonstration seems to me obtuse."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04510">And then I heard: "The ancient and the new<br/>

  Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br/>

  Why dost thou take them for the word divine?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04511">And I: "The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br/>

  Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br/>

  Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04512">'Twas answered me: "Say, who assureth thee<br/>

  That those works ever were? the thing itself<br/>

  That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04513">"Were the world to Christianity converted,"<br/>

  I said, "withouten miracles, this one<br/>

  Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04514">Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br/>

  Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br/>

  Which was a vine and has become a thorn!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04515">This being finished, the high, holy Court<br/>

  Resounded through the spheres, "One God we praise!"<br/>

  In melody that there above is chanted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04516">And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br/>

  Examining, had thus conducted me,<br/>

  Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04517">Again began: "The Grace that dallying<br/>

  Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br/>

  Up to this point, as it should opened be,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04518">So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br/>

  But now thou must express what thou believest,<br/>

  And whence to thy belief it was presented."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04519">"O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br/>

  What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,<br/>

  Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04520">Began I, "thou dost wish me in this place<br/>

  The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br/>

  And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04521">And I respond: In one God I believe,<br/>

  Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br/>

  With love and with desire, himself unmoved;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04522">And of such faith not only have I proofs<br/>

  Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br/>

  Likewise the truth that from this place rains down<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04523">Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br/>

  Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br/>

  After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04524">In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br/>

  One essence I believe, so one and trine<br/>

  They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04525">With the profound condition and divine<br/>

  Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br/>

  Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04526">This the beginning is, this is the spark<br/>

  Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br/>

  And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04527">Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br/>

  His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br/>

  For the good news as soon as he is silent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04528">So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br/>

  Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br/>

  The apostolic light, at whose command<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04529">I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p>
<p id="id04530" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXV</p>
<p id="id04531" style="margin-top: 2em">If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred,<br/>

  To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,<br/>

  So that it many a year hath made me lean,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04532">O'ercome the cruelty that bars me out<br/>

  From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<br/>

  An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04533">With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<br/>

  Poet will I return, and at my font<br/>

  Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04534">Because into the Faith that maketh known<br/>

  All souls to God there entered I, and then<br/>

  Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04535">Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br/>

  Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br/>

  Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04536">And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Look, look! behold the Baron<br/>

  For whom below Galicia is frequented."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04537">In the same way as, when a dove alights<br/>

  Near his companion, both of them pour forth,<br/>

  Circling about and murmuring, their affection,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04538">So one beheld I by the other grand<br/>

  Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,<br/>

  Lauding the food that there above is eaten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04539">But when their gratulations were complete,<br/>

  Silently 'coram me' each one stood still,<br/>

  So incandescent it o'ercame my sight.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04540">Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br/>

  "Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br/>

  Of our Basilica have been described,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04541">Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br/>

  Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<br/>

  As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness."—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04542">"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br/>

  For what comes hither from the mortal world<br/>

  Must needs be ripened in our radiance."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04543">This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br/>

  Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br/>

  Which bent them down before with too great weight.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04544">"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br/>

  Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,<br/>

  In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04545">So that, the truth beholden of this court,<br/>

  Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,<br/>

  Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04546">Say what it is, and how is flowering with it<br/>

  Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee."<br/>

  Thus did the second light again continue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04547">And the Compassionate, who piloted<br/>

  The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br/>

  Did in reply anticipate me thus:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04548">"No child whatever the Church Militant<br/>

  Of greater hope possesses, as is written<br/>

  In that Sun which irradiates all our band;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04549">Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt<br/>

  To come into Jerusalem to see,<br/>

  Or ever yet his warfare be completed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04550">The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br/>

  Have been demanded, but that he report<br/>

  How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04551">To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br/>

  Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br/>

  And may the grace of God in this assist him!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04552">As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br/>

  Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br/>

  That his proficiency may be displayed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04553">"Hope," said I, "is the certain expectation<br/>

  Of future glory, which is the effect<br/>

  Of grace divine and merit precedent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04554">From many stars this light comes unto me;<br/>

  But he instilled it first into my heart<br/>

  Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04555">'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody<br/>

  He sayeth, 'those who know thy name;' and who<br/>

  Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04556">Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling<br/>

  In the Epistle, so that I am full,<br/>

  And upon others rain again your rain."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04557">While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br/>

  Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br/>

  Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04558">Then breathed: "The love wherewith I am inflamed<br/>

  Towards the virtue still which followed me<br/>

  Unto the palm and issue of the field,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04559">Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br/>

  In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br/>

  Whatever things Hope promises to thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04560">And I: "The ancient Scriptures and the new<br/>

  The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br/>

  Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04561">Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<br/>

  In his own land shall be with twofold garments,<br/>

  And his own land is this delightful life.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04562">Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,<br/>

  There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br/>

  This revelation manifests to us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04563">And first, and near the ending of these words,<br/>

  "Sperent in te" from over us was heard,<br/>

  To which responsive answered all the carols.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04564">Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br/>

  So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br/>

  Winter would have a month of one sole day.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04565">And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br/>

  A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br/>

  To the new bride, and not from any failing,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04566">Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br/>

  Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br/>

  As was beseeming to their ardent love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04567">Into the song and music there it entered;<br/>

  And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br/>

  Even as a bride silent and motionless.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04568">"This is the one who lay upon the breast<br/>

  Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br/>

  To the great office from the cross elected."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04569">My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br/>

  Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br/>

  Before or afterward these words of hers.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04570">Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br/>

  To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br/>

  And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04571">So I became before that latest fire,<br/>

  While it was said, "Why dost thou daze thyself<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04572">Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04574">And at this utterance the flaming circle<br/>

  Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04575">As to escape from danger or fatigue<br/>

  The oars that erst were in the water beaten<br/>

  Are all suspended at a whistle's sound.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04576">Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,<br/>

  When I turned round to look on Beatrice,<br/>

<p id="id04864">Even such was I while gazing at the living<br/>

  Charity of the man, who in this world<br/>

  By contemplation tasted of that peace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04865">"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,<br/>

  "Will not be known to thee by keeping ever<br/>

  Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<br/>

  To whom this realm is subject and devoted."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04867">I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn<br/>

  The oriental part of the horizon<br/>

  Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,<br/>

<p id="id04868">Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04899">And this is clearly and expressly noted<br/>

  For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins<br/>

  With innocence, to work out their salvation<br/>

  Sufficient was the faith of parents only.<br/>

  Behoved it that the males by circumcision<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04904">But after that the time of grace had come<br/>

  Without the baptism absolute of Christ,<br/>

  Such innocence below there was retained.<br/>

<p id="id04905">Look now into the face that unto Christ<br/>

  Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only<br/>

  Is able to prepare thee to see Christ."<br/>

<p id="id04906">On her did I behold so great a gladness<br/>

  Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds<br/>

  Created through that altitude to fly,<br/>

<p id="id04907">That whatsoever I had seen before<br/>

  Did not suspend me in such admiration,<br/>

<p id="id04909">Unto the canticle divine responded<br/>

  From every part the court beatified,<br/>

  So that each sight became serener for it.<br/>

<p id="id04910">"O holy father, who for me endurest<br/>

  To be below here, leaving the sweet place<br/>

  In which thou sittest by eternal lot,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04911">Who is the Angel that with so much joy<br/>

  Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,<br/>

  Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04912">Thus I again recourse had to the teaching<br/>

  Of that one who delighted him in Mary<br/>

  As doth the star of morning in the sun.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04913">And he to me: "Such gallantry and grace<br/>

  As there can be in Angel and in soul,<br/>

  All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04914">Because he is the one who bore the palm<br/>

  Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br/>

  To take our burden on himself decreed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04915">But now come onward with thine eyes, as I<br/>

  Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians<br/>

  Of this most just and merciful of empires.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04916">Those two that sit above there most enrapture<br/>

  As being very near unto Augusta,<br/>

  Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04917">He who upon the left is near her placed<br/>

  The father is, by whose audacious taste<br/>

  The human species so much bitter tastes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04918">Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<br/>

  Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ<br/>

  The keys committed of this lovely flower.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04919">And he who all the evil days beheld,<br/>

  Before his death, of her the beauteous bride<br/>

  Who with the spear and with the nails was won,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04920">Beside him sits, and by the other rests<br/>

  That leader under whom on manna lived<br/>

  The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.<br/>

<p id="id04922">And opposite the eldest household father<br/>

  Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br/>

<p id="id04923">But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br/>

  Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br/>

  Who makes the gown according to his cloth,<br/>

  That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br/>

  As far as possible through his effulgence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04925">Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br/>

  Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br/>

  By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04926">Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br/>

  And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br/>

</p>
<p id="id04942">The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br/>

  Was of my own accord such as he wished;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04946">Because my sight, becoming purified,<br/>

  Was entering more and more into the ray<br/>

  Of the High Light which of itself is true.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04947">From that time forward what I saw was greater<br/>

  Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br/>

  And yields the memory unto such excess.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04948">Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br/>

  And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br/>

  Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04949">Even such am I, for almost utterly<br/>

  Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br/>

  Within my heart the sweetness born of it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04950">Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br/>

  Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br/>

  Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.<br/>

  It may bequeath unto the future people;<br/>

<p id="id04953">For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br/>

  And by a little sounding in these verses,<br/>

  More of thy victory shall be conceived!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04954">I think the keenness of the living ray<br/>

  Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br/>

  If but mine eyes had been averted from it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04955">And I remember that I was more bold<br/>

  On this account to bear, so that I joined<br/>

  My aspect with the Glory Infinite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04956">O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br/>

  To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br/>

  So that the seeing I consumed therein!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04957">I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br/>

  Bound up with love together in one volume,<br/>

  What through the universe in leaves is scattered;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04958">Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br/>

  All interfused together in such wise<br/>

  That what I speak of is one simple light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04959">The universal fashion of this knot<br/>

  Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br/>

  In saying this I feel that I rejoice.<br/>

<p id="id04960">One moment is more lethargy to me,<br/>

  Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br/>

  That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04961">My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br/>

  Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br/>

  And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04962">In presence of that light one such becomes,<br/>

  That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br/>

  It is impossible he e'er consent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04963">Because the good, which object is of will,<br/>

  Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br/>

  That is defective which is perfect there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04964">Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br/>

  Of what I yet remember, than an infant's<br/>

  Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04965">Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br/>

  Was in the living light on which I looked,<br/>

  For it is always what it was before;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04966">But through the sight, that fortified itself<br/>

  In me by looking, one appearance only<br/>

  To me was ever changing as I changed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04967">Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br/>

  Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br/>

  Of threefold colour and of one dimension,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04968">And by the second seemed the first reflected<br/>

  As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br/>

  Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04969">O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br/>

  Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br/>

  Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04970">O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br/>

  Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br/>

  And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04971">That circulation, which being thus conceived<br/>

  Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br/>

  When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04972">Within itself, of its own very colour<br/>

  Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br/>

  Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04973">As the geometrician, who endeavours<br/>

  To square the circle, and discovers not,<br/>

  By taking thought, the principle he wants,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04974">Even such was I at that new apparition;<br/>

  I wished to see how the image to the circle<br/>

  Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04975">But my own wings were not enough for this,<br/>

  Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br/>

  A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04976">Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br/>

  But now was turning my desire and will,<br/>

  Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<br/>

BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW (1807-1882)</h4>

<p id="id04981">Oft have I seen at some cathedral door<br/>

  A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,<br/>

  Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet<br/>

  Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor<br/>

Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er;<br/>

  Far off the noises of the world retreat;<br/>

  The loud vociferations of the street<br/>

  Become an undistinguishable roar.<br/>

So, as I enter here from day to day,<br/>

  And leave my burden at this minster gate,<br/>

  Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,<br/>

The tumult of the time disconsolate<br/>

  To inarticulate murmurs dies away,<br/>

  While the eternal ages watch and wait.<br/>

<p id="id04983">How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!<br/>

  This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves<br/>

  Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves<br/>

  Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,<br/>

And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!<br/>

  But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves<br/>

  Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,<br/>

  And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!<br/>

Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,<br/>

  What exultations trampling on despair,<br/>

  What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br/>

What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br/>

  Uprose this poem of the earth and air,<br/>

  This mediaeval miracle of song!<br/>

<p id="id04985">I enter, and I see thee in the gloom<br/>

  Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!<br/>

  And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.<br/>

  The air is filled with some unknown perfume;<br/>

The congregation of the dead make room<br/>

  For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;<br/>

  Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine,<br/>

  The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.<br/>

From the confessionals I hear arise<br/>

  Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,<br/>

  And lamentations from the crypts below<br/>

And then a voice celestial that begins<br/>

  With the pathetic words, "Although your sins<br/>

  As scarlet be," and ends with "as the snow."<br/>

<h4 id="id04986" style="margin-top: 2em">IV</h4>
<p id="id04987">With snow-white veil, and garments as of flame,<br/>

  She stands before thee, who so long ago<br/>

  Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe<br/>

  From which thy song in all its splendors came;<br/>

And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,<br/>

  The ice about thy heart melts as the snow<br/>

  On mountain heights, and in swift overflow<br/>

  Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.<br/>

Thou makest full confession; and a gleam<br/>

  As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,<br/>

  Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;<br/>

Lethe and Eunoe—the remembered dream<br/>

  And the forgotten sorrow—bring at last<br/>

  That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.<br/>

  Here martyred and hereafter glorified;<br/>

  And the great Rose upon its leaves displays<br/>

Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,<br/>

  With splendor upon splendor multiplied;<br/>

  And Beatrice again at Dante's side<br/>

  No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.<br/>

And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs<br/>

  Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love<br/>

  And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;<br/>

And the melodious bells among the spires<br/>

  O'er all the house-tops and through heaven above<br/>

  Proclaim the elevation of the Host!<br/>

  O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines<br/>

  Above the darkness of the Apennines,<br/>

  Forerunner of the day that is to be!<br/>

The voices of the city and the sea,<br/>

  The voices of the mountains and the pines,<br/>

  Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines<br/>

  Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!<br/>

Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,<br/>

  Through all the nations; and a sound is heard,<br/>

  As of a mighty wind, and men devout,<br/>

Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,<br/>

  In their own language hear thy wondrous word,<br/>

  And many are amazed and many doubt.<br/>

<p id="id04993" style="margin-top: 2em">     'Ich habe unter meinen Papieren ein Blatt gefunden,<br/>

     wo ich die Baukunst eine erstarrte Musik nenne.'<br/>

        (Johann Wolfgang Goethe, 1829 March 23)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id04994">I found Dante in a bar.  The Poet had indeed lost the True Way to be found
reduced to party chatter in a Capitol Hill basement, but I had found him at
last.  I must have been drinking in the Dark Tavern of Error, for I did not
even realize I had begun the dolorous path followed by many since the
Poet's journey of A.D. 1300.  Actually no one spoke a word about Dante or
his Divine Comedy, rather I heard a second-hand Goethe call architecture
"frozen music."  Soon I took my second step through the gate to a people
lost; this time on a more respectable occasion—a lecture at the Catholic
University of America.  Clio, the muse of history, must have been aiding
Prof. Schumacher that evening, because it sustained my full three-hour
attention, even after I had just presented an all-night project.  There I
heard of a most astonishing Italian translation of 'la Divina Commedia' di
Dante Alighieri.  An Italian architect, Giuseppi Terragni, had translated
the Comedy into the 'Danteum,' a projected stone and glass monument to Poet
and Poem near the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome.</p>
<p id="id04995">Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City.  In true Dantean form,
politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938.  Ironically this
literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form.
Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music.  Did
Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song?  Certainly a
cold-poem seems artistically repulsive.  Unflattering comparisons to the
lake of Cocytus spring to mind too.  While I cannot read Italian, I can read
some German.  After locating the original quotation I discovered that
'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original
'erstarrte.'  The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to
stiffen.'  This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not
necessarily chill in the transformation.  Nor can simple thawing yield the
original work.  Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a
muse.  Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem.
Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a
non-literary work.  The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni
generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.</p>
<p id="id04996" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     The poem is divided into three canticles of thirty-three cantos
     each, plus one extra in the first, the Inferno, making a total of
     one hundred cantos.  Each canto is composed of three-line tercets,
     the first and third lines rhyme, the second line rhymes with the
     beginning of the next tercet, establishing a kind of overlap,
     reflected in the overlapping motif of the Danteum design.  Dante's
     realms are further subdivided: the Inferno is composed of nine
     levels, the vestibule makes a tenth.  Purgatory has seven
     terraces, plus two ledges in an ante-purgatory; adding these to
     the Earthly Paradise yields ten zones.  Paradise is composed of
     nine heavens; Empyrean makes the tenth.  In the Inferno, sinners
     are organized by three vices—Incontinence, Violence, and
     Fraud—and further subdivided by the seven deadly sins.  In
     Purgatory, penance is ordered on the basis of three types of
     natural love.  Paradise is organized on the basis of three types
     of Divine Love, and further subdivided according to the three
     theological and four cardinal virtues.
        (Thomas Schumacher, "The Danteum,"
         Princeton Architectural Press, 1993)</p>
<p id="id04997">By translating the structure, Terragni could then layer the literal and the
spiritual meanings of the Poem without allowing either to dominate.  These
layers of meaning are native to the Divine Comedy as they are native to
much medieval literature, although modern readers and tourists may not be
so familiar with them.  They are literal, allegorical, moral, and
anagogical.  I offer you St. Thomas of Aquinas' definition of these last
three as they relate to Sacred Scripture:</p>
<p id="id04998" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     . . .this spiritual sense has a threefold division. . .so far as
     the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law,
     there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in
     Christ, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are types
     of what we ought to do, there is the moral sense.  But so far as
     they signify what relates to eternal glory, there is the
     anagogical sense.    (Summa Theologica I, 1, 10)</p>
<p id="id04999">Within the Danteum the Poet's meanings lurk in solid form.  An example: the
Danteum design does have spaces literally associated with the Comedy—the
Dark Wood of Error, Inferno, Purgatorio, and the Paradiso—but these spaces
also relate among themselves spiritually.  Dante often highlights a virtue
by first condemning its corruption.  Within Dante's system Justice is the
greatest of the cardinal virtues; its corruption, Fraud, is the most
contemptible of vices.  Because Dante saw the papacy as the most precious of
sacred institutions, corrupt popes figure prominently among the damned in
the Poet's Inferno.  In the Danteum the materiality of the worldly Dark Wood
directly opposes the transcendence of the Paradiso.  In the realm of error
every thought is lost and secular, while in heaven every soul's intent is
directed toward God.  The shadowy Inferno of the Danteum mirrors the
Purgatorio's illuminated ascent to heaven.  Purgatory embodies hope and
growth where hell chases its own dark inertia.  Such is the cosmography
shared by Terragni and Dante.</p>
<p id="id05000">In this postscript I intend neither to fully examine the meaning nor the
plan of the Danteum, but rather to evince the power that art has acted as a
catalyst to other artists.  The Danteum, a modern design inspired by a
medieval poem, is but one example.  Dante's poem is filled with characters
epitomizing the full range of vices and virtues of human personalities.
Dante's characters come from his present and literature's past; they are
mythological, biblical, classical, ancient, and medieval.  They, rather than
Calliope and her sisters, were Dante's muses.</p>
<p id="id05001">'La Divina Commedia' seems a natural candidate to complete Project
Gutenberg's first milleditio and to begin its second thousand e-texts.
Although distinctly medieval, its continuum of influence spans the
Renaissance and modernity.  Terragni saw his place within the Comedy as
surely as Dante saw his own.  We too fit within Dante's understanding of the
human condition; we differ less from our past than we might like to
believe.  T. S. Eliot understood this when he wrote "Dante and Shakespeare
divide the modern world between them, there is no third."  So now Dante
joins Shakespeare (e-text #100) in the Project Gutenberg collection.  Two
works that influenced Dante are also part of the collection: The Bible
(#10) and Virgil's Aeneid (#227).  Other major influences—St. Thomas of
Aquinas' Summa Theologica, The Metamorphoses of Ovid, and Aristotle's
Nicomachean Ethics—are available in electronic form at other Internet
sites.  If one searches enough he may even find a computer rendering of the
Danteum on the Internet.  By presenting this electronic text to Project
Gutenberg it is my hope that in will not rest in a computer unknown and
unread; it is my hope that artists will see themselves in the Divine Comedy
and be inspired, just as Dante ran the paths left by Virgil and St. Thomas
that led him to the stars.</p>
