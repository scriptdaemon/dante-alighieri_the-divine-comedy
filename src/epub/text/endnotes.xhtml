					<p>In this passage Dante but expresses the universal veneration felt for Virgil during the Middle Ages, and especially in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Italy</span>.

					<p>In the popular imagination Virgil became a mythical personage and a mighty magician.

					<p><cite>Mr. Ruskin, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Modern Painters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 240</cite>, speaking of Dante’s use of the word “<i xml:lang="it">bruno</i>,” says:⁠—</p>
					<p>“In describing a simple twilight⁠—not a Hades twilight, but an ordinarily fair evening⁠—(<cite><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Inf.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>. 1</cite>), he says, the ‘brown’ air took the animals away from their fatigues;⁠—the waves under Charon’s boat are ‘brown’ (<cite><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Inf.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iii</span>. 117</cite>); and Lethe, which is perfectly clear and yet dark, as with oblivion, is ‘bruna-bruna,’ ‘brown, <em>exceeding</em> brown’ Now, clearly in all these cases no <em>warmth</em> is meant to be mingled in the color. Dante had never seen one of our bog-streams, with its porter-colored foam; and there can be no doubt that, in calling Lethe brown, he means that it was dark slate-gray, inclining to black; as, for instance, our clear <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cumberland</span> lakes, which, looked straight down upon where they are deep, seem to be lakes of ink. I am sure this is the color he means; because no clear stream or lake on the Continent ever looks brown, but blue or green; and Dante, by merely taking away the pleasant color, would get at once to this idea of grave clear gray. So, when he was talking of twilight, his eye for color was far too good to let him call it <em>brown</em> in our sense. Twilight is not brown, but purple, golden, or dark gray; and this last was what Dante meant. Farther, I find that this negation of color is always the means by which Dante subdues his tones. Thus the fatal inscription on the Hades gate is written in ‘obscure color,’ and the air which torments the passionate spirits is ‘aer nero,’ <em>black</em> air (<cite><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Inf.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span>. 51</cite>), called presently afterwards (<cite>line 81</cite>) malignant air, just as the gray cliffs are called malignant cliffs.” <a href="../text/inferno.xhtml#noteref-25" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

Many, when she had passed, said, ‘This is not a woman, rather is she one of the most beautiful angels of heaven.’ Others said, ‘She is a miracle.

Now he makes use of a very abstruse comparison, to express how he became, from a Guelph or <em>Black</em>, a Ghibelline or <em>White</em>. He describes himself as a <em>flower</em>, first bent and closed by the night frosts, and then <em>blanched</em> or <em>whitened</em> by the sun (the symbol of reason), which opens its leaves; and what produces the effect of the sun on him is a speech of Virgil’s, persuading him to follow his guidance.” <a href="../text/inferno.xhtml#noteref-41" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>
