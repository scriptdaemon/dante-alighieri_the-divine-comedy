					<p>In this passage Dante but expresses the universal veneration felt for Virgil during the Middle Ages, and especially in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Italy</span>. Petrarch’s copy of Virgil is still preserved in the Ambrosian Library at <span epub:type="z3998:place">Milan</span>; and at the beginning of it he has recorded in a Latin note the time of his first meeting with Laura, and the date of her death, which, he says, “I write in this book, rather than elsewhere, because it comes often under my eye.”</p>
					<p>In the popular imagination Virgil became a mythical personage and a mighty magician. See the story of “Virgilius” in Thom’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Early Prose Romances</i>, 11. Dante selects him for his guide, as symbolizing human science or Philosophy. “I say and affirm,” he remarks, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. 16, “that the lady with whom I became enamored after my first love was the most beautiful and modest daughter of the Emperor of the Universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name of Philosophy.” <a href="../text/inferno.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>
