<h5 id="id00061">INFERNO</h5>
<p id="id00062" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto I</p>
<p id="id00063" style="margin-top: 2em">Midway upon the journey of our life<br/>

  I found myself within a forest dark,<br/>

  For the straightforward pathway had been lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00064">Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br/>

  What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br/>

  Which in the very thought renews the fear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00065">So bitter is it, death is little more;<br/>

  But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br/>

  Speak will I of the other things I saw there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00066">I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br/>

  So full was I of slumber at the moment<br/>

  In which I had abandoned the true way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00067">But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br/>

  At that point where the valley terminated,<br/>

  Which had with consternation pierced my heart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00068">Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br/>

  Vested already with that planet's rays<br/>

  Which leadeth others right by every road.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00069">Then was the fear a little quieted<br/>

  That in my heart's lake had endured throughout<br/>

  The night, which I had passed so piteously.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00070">And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br/>

  Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br/>

  Turns to the water perilous and gazes;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00071">So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br/>

  Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br/>

  Which never yet a living person left.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00072">After my weary body I had rested,<br/>

  The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br/>

  So that the firm foot ever was the lower.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00073">And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br/>

  A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br/>

  Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00074">And never moved she from before my face,<br/>

  Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br/>

  That many times I to return had turned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00075">The time was the beginning of the morning,<br/>

  And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br/>

  That with him were, what time the Love Divine<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00076">At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br/>

  So were to me occasion of good hope,<br/>

  The variegated skin of that wild beast,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00077">The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br/>

  But not so much, that did not give me fear<br/>

  A lion's aspect which appeared to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00078">He seemed as if against me he were coming<br/>

  With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br/>

  So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00079">And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br/>

  Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br/>

  And many folk has caused to live forlorn!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00080">She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br/>

  With the affright that from her aspect came,<br/>

  That I the hope relinquished of the height.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00081">And as he is who willingly acquires,<br/>

  And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br/>

  Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00082">E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br/>

  Which, coming on against me by degrees<br/>

  Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00083">While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br/>

  Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br/>

  Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00084">When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br/>

  "Have pity on me," unto him I cried,<br/>

  "Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00085">He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,<br/>

  And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br/>

  And Mantuans by country both of them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00086">'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,<br/>

  And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br/>

  During the time of false and lying gods.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00087">A poet was I, and I sang that just<br/>

  Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br/>

  After that Ilion the superb was burned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00088">But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br/>

  Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br/>

  Which is the source and cause of every joy?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00089">"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br/>

  Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"<br/>

  I made response to him with bashful forehead.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00090">"O, of the other poets honour and light,<br/>

  Avail me the long study and great love<br/>

  That have impelled me to explore thy volume!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00091">Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br/>

  Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br/>

  The beautiful style that has done honour to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00092">Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br/>

  Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br/>

  For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00093">"Thee it behoves to take another road,"<br/>

  Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br/>

  "If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00094">Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br/>

  Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br/>

  But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00095">And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br/>

  That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br/>

  And after food is hungrier than before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00096">Many the animals with whom she weds,<br/>

  And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br/>

  Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00097">He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br/>

  But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br/>

  'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00098">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br/>

  On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br/>

  Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00099">Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br/>

  Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br/>

  There from whence envy first did let her loose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00100">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br/>

  Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br/>

  And lead thee hence through the eternal place,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00101">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br/>

  Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br/>

  Who cry out each one for the second death;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00102">And thou shalt see those who contented are<br/>

  Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br/>

  Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00103">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br/>

  A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br/>

  With her at my departure I will leave thee;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00104">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br/>

  In that I was rebellious to his law,<br/>

  Wills that through me none come into his city.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00105">He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br/>

  There is his city and his lofty throne;<br/>

  O happy he whom thereto he elects!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00106">And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,<br/>

  By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br/>

  So that I may escape this woe and worse,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00107">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br/>

  That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br/>

  And those thou makest so disconsolate."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00108">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
<p id="id00109" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto II</p>
<p id="id00110" style="margin-top: 2em">Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br/>

  Released the animals that are on earth<br/>

  From their fatigues; and I the only one<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00111">Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br/>

  Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br/>

  Which memory that errs not shall retrace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00112">O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br/>

  O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br/>

  Here thy nobility shall be manifest!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00113">And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,<br/>

  Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br/>

  Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00114">Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br/>

  While yet corruptible, unto the world<br/>

  Immortal went, and was there bodily.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00115">But if the adversary of all evil<br/>

  Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br/>

  That issue would from him, and who, and what,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00116">To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br/>

  For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br/>

  In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00117">The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br/>

  Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br/>

  Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00118">Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br/>

  Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br/>

  Both of his victory and the papal mantle.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00119">Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br/>

  To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br/>

  Which of salvation's way is the beginning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00120">But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br/>

  I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br/>

  Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00121">Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br/>

  I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br/>

  Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00122">And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br/>

  And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br/>

  So that from his design he quite withdraws,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00123">Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br/>

  Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br/>

  Which was so very prompt in the beginning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00124">"If I have well thy language understood,"<br/>

  Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br/>

  "Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00125">Which many times a man encumbers so,<br/>

  It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br/>

  As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00126">That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br/>

  I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br/>

  At the first moment when I grieved for thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00127">Among those was I who are in suspense,<br/>

  And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br/>

  In such wise, I besought her to command me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00128">Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br/>

  And she began to say, gentle and low,<br/>

  With voice angelical, in her own language:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00129">'O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br/>

  Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br/>

  And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00130">A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br/>

  Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br/>

  Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00131">And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br/>

  That I too late have risen to his succour,<br/>

  From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00132">Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br/>

  And with what needful is for his release,<br/>

  Assist him so, that I may be consoled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00133">Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br/>

  I come from there, where I would fain return;<br/>

  Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00134">When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br/>

  Full often will I praise thee unto him.'<br/>

  Then paused she, and thereafter I began:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00135">'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br/>

  The human race exceedeth all contained<br/>

  Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00136">So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br/>

  To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;<br/>

  No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00137">But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br/>

  The here descending down into this centre,<br/>

  From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00138">'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br/>

  Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,<br/>

  'Why I am not afraid to enter here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00139">Of those things only should one be afraid<br/>

  Which have the power of doing others harm;<br/>

  Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00140">God in his mercy such created me<br/>

  That misery of yours attains me not,<br/>

  Nor any flame assails me of this burning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00141">A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br/>

  At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br/>

  So that stern judgment there above is broken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00142">In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br/>

  And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need<br/>

  Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00143">Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br/>

  Hastened away, and came unto the place<br/>

  Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00144">"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,<br/>

  Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br/>

  For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00145">Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br/>

  Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br/>

  Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00146">Never were persons in the world so swift<br/>

  To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br/>

  As I, after such words as these were uttered,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00147">Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br/>

  Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br/>

  Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00148">After she thus had spoken unto me,<br/>

  Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br/>

  Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00149">And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br/>

  I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br/>

  Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00150">What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?<br/>

  Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br/>

  Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00151">Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br/>

  Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br/>

  And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00152">Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br/>

  Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br/>

  Uplift themselves all open on their stems;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00153">Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br/>

  And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br/>

  That I began, like an intrepid person:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00154">"O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br/>

  And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br/>

  The words of truth which she addressed to thee!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00155">Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br/>

  To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br/>

  That to my first intent I have returned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00156">Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br/>

  Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."<br/>

  Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00157">I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
<p id="id00158" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto III</p>
<p id="id00159" style="margin-top: 2em">"Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br/>

  Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br/>

  Through me the way among the people lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00160">Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br/>

  Created me divine Omnipotence,<br/>

  The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00161">Before me there were no created things,<br/>

  Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br/>

  All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00162">These words in sombre colour I beheld<br/>

  Written upon the summit of a gate;<br/>

  Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00163">And he to me, as one experienced:<br/>

  "Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br/>

  All cowardice must needs be here extinct.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00164">We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br/>

  Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br/>

  Who have foregone the good of intellect."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00165">And after he had laid his hand on mine<br/>

  With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br/>

  He led me in among the secret things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00166">There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br/>

  Resounded through the air without a star,<br/>

  Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00167">Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br/>

  Accents of anger, words of agony,<br/>

  And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00168">Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br/>

  For ever in that air for ever black,<br/>

  Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00169">And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br/>

  Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?<br/>

  What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00170">And he to me: "This miserable mode<br/>

  Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br/>

  Who lived withouten infamy or praise.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00171">Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br/>

  Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br/>

  Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00172">The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br/>

  Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br/>

  For glory none the damned would have from them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00173">And I: "O Master, what so grievous is<br/>

  To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"<br/>

  He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00174">These have no longer any hope of death;<br/>

  And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br/>

  They envious are of every other fate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00175">No fame of them the world permits to be;<br/>

  Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br/>

  Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00176">And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br/>

  Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br/>

  That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00177">And after it there came so long a train<br/>

  Of people, that I ne'er would have believed<br/>

  That ever Death so many had undone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00178">When some among them I had recognised,<br/>

  I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br/>

  Who made through cowardice the great refusal.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00179">Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br/>

  That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br/>

  Hateful to God and to his enemies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00180">These miscreants, who never were alive,<br/>

  Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br/>

  By gadflies and by hornets that were there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00181">These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br/>

  Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br/>

  By the disgusting worms was gathered up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00182">And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br/>

  People I saw on a great river's bank;<br/>

  Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00183">That I may know who these are, and what law<br/>

  Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br/>

  As I discern athwart the dusky light."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00184">And he to me: "These things shall all be known<br/>

  To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br/>

  Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00185">Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br/>

  Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br/>

  From speech refrained I till we reached the river.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00186">And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br/>

  An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br/>

  Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00187">Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br/>

  I come to lead you to the other shore,<br/>

  To the eternal shades in heat and frost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00188">And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br/>

  Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"<br/>

  But when he saw that I did not withdraw,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00189">He said: "By other ways, by other ports<br/>

  Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br/>

  A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00190">And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;<br/>

  It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>

  That which is willed; and farther question not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00191">Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br/>

  Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br/>

  Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00192">But all those souls who weary were and naked<br/>

  Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br/>

  As soon as they had heard those cruel words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00193">God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br/>

  The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br/>

  Of their engendering and of their birth!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00194">Thereafter all together they drew back,<br/>

  Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br/>

  Which waiteth every man who fears not God.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00195">Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br/>

  Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br/>

  Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00196">As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br/>

  First one and then another, till the branch<br/>

  Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00197">In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br/>

  Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br/>

  At signals, as a bird unto its lure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00198">So they depart across the dusky wave,<br/>

  And ere upon the other side they land,<br/>

  Again on this side a new troop assembles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00199">"My son," the courteous Master said to me,<br/>

  "All those who perish in the wrath of God<br/>

  Here meet together out of every land;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00200">And ready are they to pass o'er the river,<br/>

  Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br/>

  So that their fear is turned into desire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00201">This way there never passes a good soul;<br/>

  And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br/>

  Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00202">This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br/>

  Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br/>

  The recollection bathes me still with sweat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00203">The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br/>

  And fulminated a vermilion light,<br/>

  Which overmastered in me every sense,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00204">And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
<p id="id00205" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IV</p>
<p id="id00206" style="margin-top: 2em">Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br/>

  A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br/>

  Like to a person who by force is wakened;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00207">And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br/>

  Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br/>

  To recognise the place wherein I was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00208">True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br/>

  Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br/>

  That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00209">Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br/>

  So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br/>

  Nothing whatever I discerned therein.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00210">"Let us descend now into the blind world,"<br/>

  Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br/>

  "I will be first, and thou shalt second be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00211">And I, who of his colour was aware,<br/>

  Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br/>

  Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00212">And he to me: "The anguish of the people<br/>

  Who are below here in my face depicts<br/>

  That pity which for terror thou hast taken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00213">Let us go on, for the long way impels us."<br/>

  Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br/>

  The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00214">There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br/>

  Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br/>

  That tremble made the everlasting air.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00215">And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br/>

  Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br/>

  Of infants and of women and of men.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00216">To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask<br/>

  What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br/>

  Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00217">That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br/>

  'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br/>

  Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00218">And if they were before Christianity,<br/>

  In the right manner they adored not God;<br/>

  And among such as these am I myself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00219">For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br/>

  Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br/>

  That without hope we live on in desire."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00220">Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br/>

  Because some people of much worthiness<br/>

  I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00221">"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"<br/>

  Began I, with desire of being certain<br/>

  Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00222">"Came any one by his own merit hence,<br/>

  Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"<br/>

  And he, who understood my covert speech,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00223">Replied: "I was a novice in this state,<br/>

  When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br/>

  With sign of victory incoronate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00224">Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br/>

  And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br/>

  Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00225">Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br/>

  Israel with his father and his children,<br/>

  And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00226">And others many, and he made them blessed;<br/>

  And thou must know, that earlier than these<br/>

  Never were any human spirits saved."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00227">We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br/>

  But still were passing onward through the forest,<br/>

  The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00228">Not very far as yet our way had gone<br/>

  This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br/>

  That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00229">We were a little distant from it still,<br/>

  But not so far that I in part discerned not<br/>

  That honourable people held that place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00230">"O thou who honourest every art and science,<br/>

  Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br/>

  That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00231">And he to me: "The honourable name,<br/>

  That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br/>

  Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00232">In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br/>

  "All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br/>

  His shade returns again, that was departed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00233">After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br/>

  Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br/>

  Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00234">To say to me began my gracious Master:<br/>

  "Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br/>

  Who comes before the three, even as their lord.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00235">That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br/>

  He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br/>

  The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00236">Because to each of these with me applies<br/>

  The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br/>

  They do me honour, and in that do well."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00237">Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br/>

  Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br/>

  Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00238">When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br/>

  They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br/>

  And on beholding this, my Master smiled;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00239">And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br/>

  In that they made me one of their own band;<br/>

  So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00240">Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br/>

  Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,<br/>

  As was the saying of them where I was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00241">We came unto a noble castle's foot,<br/>

  Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br/>

  Defended round by a fair rivulet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00242">This we passed over even as firm ground;<br/>

  Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br/>

  We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00243">People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br/>

  Of great authority in their countenance;<br/>

  They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00244">Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br/>

  Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br/>

  So that they all of them were visible.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00245">There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br/>

  Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br/>

  Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00246">I saw Electra with companions many,<br/>

  'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br/>

  Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00247">I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br/>

  On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br/>

  Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00248">I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br/>

  Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br/>

  And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00249">When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br/>

  The Master I beheld of those who know,<br/>

  Sit with his philosophic family.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00250">All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br/>

  There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br/>

  Who nearer him before the others stand;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00251">Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br/>

  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br/>

  Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00252">Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br/>

  Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br/>

  Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00253">Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br/>

  Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br/>

  Averroes, who the great Comment made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00254">I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br/>

  Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br/>

  That many times the word comes short of fact.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00255">The sixfold company in two divides;<br/>

  Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br/>

  Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00256">And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>
<p id="id00257" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto V</p>
<p id="id00258" style="margin-top: 2em">Thus I descended out of the first circle<br/>

  Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br/>

  And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00259">There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br/>

  Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br/>

  Judges, and sends according as he girds him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00260">I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br/>

  Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br/>

  And this discriminator of transgressions<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00261">Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br/>

  Girds himself with his tail as many times<br/>

  As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00262">Always before him many of them stand;<br/>

  They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br/>

  They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00263">"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br/>

  Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br/>

  Leaving the practice of so great an office,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00264">"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br/>

  Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."<br/>

  And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00265">Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br/>

  It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>

  That which is willed; and ask no further question."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00266">And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br/>

  Audible unto me; now am I come<br/>

  There where much lamentation strikes upon me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00267">I came into a place mute of all light,<br/>

  Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br/>

  If by opposing winds 't is combated.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00268">The infernal hurricane that never rests<br/>

  Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br/>

  Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00269">When they arrive before the precipice,<br/>

  There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br/>

  There they blaspheme the puissance divine.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00270">I understood that unto such a torment<br/>

  The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br/>

  Who reason subjugate to appetite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00271">And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br/>

  In the cold season in large band and full,<br/>

  So doth that blast the spirits maledict;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00272">It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br/>

  No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br/>

  Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00273">And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br/>

  Making in air a long line of themselves,<br/>

  So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00274">Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br/>

  Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those<br/>

  People, whom the black air so castigates?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00275">"The first of those, of whom intelligence<br/>

  Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,<br/>

  "The empress was of many languages.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00276">To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br/>

  That lustful she made licit in her law,<br/>

  To remove the blame to which she had been led.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00277">She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br/>

  That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br/>

  She held the land which now the Sultan rules.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00278">The next is she who killed herself for love,<br/>

  And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br/>

  Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00279">Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br/>

  Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br/>

  Who at the last hour combated with Love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00280">Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br/>

  Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br/>

  Whom Love had separated from our life.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00281">After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br/>

  Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br/>

  Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00282">And I began: "O Poet, willingly<br/>

  Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br/>

  And seem upon the wind to be so light."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00283">And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be<br/>

  Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br/>

  By love which leadeth them, and they will come."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00284">Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br/>

  My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!<br/>

  Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00285">As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br/>

  With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br/>

  Fly through the air by their volition borne,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00286">So came they from the band where Dido is,<br/>

  Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br/>

  So strong was the affectionate appeal.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00287">"O living creature gracious and benignant,<br/>

  Who visiting goest through the purple air<br/>

  Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00288">If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br/>

  We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br/>

  Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00289">Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br/>

  That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br/>

  While silent is the wind, as it is now.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00290">Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br/>

  Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br/>

  To rest in peace with all his retinue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00291">Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br/>

  Seized this man for the person beautiful<br/>

  That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00292">Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br/>

  Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br/>

  That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00293">Love has conducted us unto one death;<br/>

  Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"<br/>

  These words were borne along from them to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00294">As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br/>

  I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br/>

  Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00295">When I made answer, I began: "Alas!<br/>

  How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br/>

  Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00296">Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br/>

  And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,<br/>

  Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00297">But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br/>

  By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br/>

  That you should know your dubious desires?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00298">And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow<br/>

  Than to be mindful of the happy time<br/>

  In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00299">But, if to recognise the earliest root<br/>

  Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br/>

  I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00300">One day we reading were for our delight<br/>

  Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br/>

  Alone we were and without any fear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00301">Full many a time our eyes together drew<br/>

  That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br/>

  But one point only was it that o'ercame us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00302">When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br/>

  Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br/>

  This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00303">Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br/>

  Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br/>

  That day no farther did we read therein."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00304">And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br/>

  The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br/>

  I swooned away as if I had been dying,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00305">And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>
<p id="id00306" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VI</p>
<p id="id00307" style="margin-top: 2em">At the return of consciousness, that closed<br/>

  Before the pity of those two relations,<br/>

  Which utterly with sadness had confused me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00308">New torments I behold, and new tormented<br/>

  Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br/>

  And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00309">In the third circle am I of the rain<br/>

  Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br/>

  Its law and quality are never new.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00310">Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br/>

  Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br/>

  Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00311">Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br/>

  With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br/>

  Over the people that are there submerged.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00312">Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br/>

  And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br/>

  He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00313">Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br/>

  One side they make a shelter for the other;<br/>

  Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00314">When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br/>

   His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br/>

   Not a limb had he that was motionless.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00315">And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br/>

  Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br/>

  He threw it into those rapacious gullets.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00316">Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br/>

  And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br/>

  For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00317">The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br/>

  Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br/>

  Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00318">We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br/>

  The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br/>

  Upon their vanity that person seems.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00319">They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br/>

  Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br/>

  As he beheld us passing on before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00320">"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"<br/>

  He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;<br/>

  Thyself wast made before I was unmade."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00321">And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast<br/>

  Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00322">But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br/>

  A place art put, and in such punishment,<br/>

  If some are greater, none is so displeasing."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00323">And he to me: "Thy city, which is full<br/>

<p id="id00325">And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br/>

  For all these suffer the like penalty<br/>

  For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00326">I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br/>

  Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br/>

  But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00327">The citizens of the divided city;<br/>

  If any there be just; and the occasion<br/>

  Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00328">And he to me: "They, after long contention,<br/>

  Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br/>

  Will drive the other out with much offence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00329">Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br/>

  Within three suns, and rise again the other<br/>

  By force of him who now is on the coast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00330">High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br/>

  Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br/>

  Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00331">The just are two, and are not understood there;<br/>

  Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br/>

  Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00332">Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br/>

  And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,<br/>

  And make a gift to me of further speech.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00333">Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br/>

  Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br/>

  And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00334">Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br/>

  For great desire constraineth me to learn<br/>

  If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00335">And he: "They are among the blacker souls;<br/>

  A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br/>

  If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00336">But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br/>

  I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br/>

  No more I tell thee and no more I answer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00337">Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br/>

  Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br/>

  He fell therewith prone like the other blind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00338">And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more<br/>

  This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br/>

  When shall approach the hostile Potentate,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00339">Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br/>

  Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br/>

  Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00340">So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture<br/>

  Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br/>

  Touching a little on the future life.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00341">Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,<br/>

  Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br/>

  Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00342">And he to me: "Return unto thy science,<br/>

  Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br/>

  The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00343">Albeit that this people maledict<br/>

  To true perfection never can attain,<br/>

  Hereafter more than now they look to be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00344">Round in a circle by that road we went,<br/>

  Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br/>

  We came unto the point where the descent is;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00345">There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>
<p id="id00346" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VII</p>
<p id="id00347" style="margin-top: 2em">"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"<br/>

  Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br/>

  And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00348">Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear<br/>

  Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br/>

  Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00349">Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br/>

  And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br/>

  Consume within thyself with thine own rage.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00350">Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br/>

  Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br/>

  Vengeance upon the proud adultery."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00351">Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br/>

  Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br/>

  So fell the cruel monster to the earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00352">Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br/>

  Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br/>

  Which all the woe of the universe insacks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00353">Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br/>

  New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br/>

  And why doth our transgression waste us so?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00354">As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br/>

  That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br/>

  So here the folk must dance their roundelay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00355">Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br/>

  On one side and the other, with great howls,<br/>

  Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00356">They clashed together, and then at that point<br/>

  Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br/>

  Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00357">Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br/>

  On either hand unto the opposite point,<br/>

  Shouting their shameful metre evermore.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00358">Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br/>

  Through his half-circle to another joust;<br/>

  And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00359">Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me<br/>

  What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br/>

  These shaven crowns upon the left of us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00360">And he to me: "All of them were asquint<br/>

  In intellect in the first life, so much<br/>

  That there with measure they no spending made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00361">Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br/>

  Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,<br/>

  Where sunders them the opposite defect.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00362">Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br/>

  Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br/>

  In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00363">And I: "My Master, among such as these<br/>

  I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br/>

  Who were infected with these maladies."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00364">And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;<br/>

  The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br/>

  Now makes them unto all discernment dim.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00365">Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br/>

  These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br/>

  With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00366">Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br/>

  Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br/>

  Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00367">Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br/>

  Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br/>

  For which the human race each other buffet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00368">For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br/>

  Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br/>

  Could never make a single one repose."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00369">"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also<br/>

  What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br/>

  That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00370">And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,<br/>

  What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br/>

  Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00371">He whose omniscience everything transcends<br/>

  The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br/>

  That every part to every part may shine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00372">Distributing the light in equal measure;<br/>

  He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br/>

  Ordained a general ministress and guide,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00373">That she might change at times the empty treasures<br/>

  From race to race, from one blood to another,<br/>

  Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00374">Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br/>

  Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br/>

  Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00375">Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br/>

  She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br/>

  Her governance, as theirs the other gods.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00376">Her permutations have not any truce;<br/>

  Necessity makes her precipitate,<br/>

  So often cometh who his turn obtains.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00377">And this is she who is so crucified<br/>

  Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br/>

  Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00378">But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br/>

  Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br/>

  She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00379">Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br/>

  Already sinks each star that was ascending<br/>

  When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00380">We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br/>

  Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br/>

  Along a gully that runs out of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00381">The water was more sombre far than perse;<br/>

  And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br/>

  Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00382">A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br/>

  This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br/>

  Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00383">And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br/>

  Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br/>

  All of them naked and with angry look.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00384">They smote each other not alone with hands,<br/>

  But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br/>

  Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00385">Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest<br/>

  The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br/>

  And likewise I would have thee know for certain<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00386">Beneath the water people are who sigh<br/>

  And make this water bubble at the surface,<br/>

  As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00387">Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were<br/>

  In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br/>

  Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00388">Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'<br/>

  This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br/>

  For with unbroken words they cannot say it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00389">Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br/>

  A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br/>

  With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00390">Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>
<p id="id00391" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto VIII</p>
<p id="id00392" style="margin-top: 2em">I say, continuing, that long before<br/>

  We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br/>

  Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00393">By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br/>

  And from afar another answer them,<br/>

  So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00394">And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br/>

  I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br/>

  That other fire? and who are they that made it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00395">And he to me: "Across the turbid waves<br/>

  What is expected thou canst now discern,<br/>

  If reek of the morass conceal it not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00396">Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br/>

  That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br/>

  As I beheld a very little boat<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00397">Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,<br/>

  Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br/>

  Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00398">"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br/>

  For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us<br/>

  Longer than in the passing of the slough."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00399">As he who listens to some great deceit<br/>

  That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br/>

  Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00400">My Guide descended down into the boat,<br/>

  And then he made me enter after him,<br/>

  And only when I entered seemed it laden.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00401">Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br/>

  The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br/>

  More of the water than 'tis wont with others.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00402">While we were running through the dead canal,<br/>

  Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br/>

  And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00403">And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;<br/>

  But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"<br/>

  "Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00404">And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,<br/>

  Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br/>

  For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00405">Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br/>

  Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br/>

  Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00406">Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br/>

  He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,<br/>

  Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00407">That was an arrogant person in the world;<br/>

  Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br/>

  So likewise here his shade is furious.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00408">How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br/>

  Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br/>

  Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00409">And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,<br/>

  If I could see him soused into this broth,<br/>

  Before we issue forth out of the lake."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00410">And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore<br/>

  Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br/>

  Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00411">A little after that, I saw such havoc<br/>

  Made of him by the people of the mire,<br/>

  That still I praise and thank my God for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00412">They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"<br/>

  And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br/>

  Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00413">We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br/>

  But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br/>

  Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00414">And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,<br/>

  The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br/>

  With the grave citizens, with the great throng."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00415">And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br/>

  Within there in the valley I discern<br/>

  Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00416">They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal<br/>

  That kindles them within makes them look red,<br/>

  As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00417">Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br/>

  That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br/>

  The walls appeared to me to be of iron.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00418">Not without making first a circuit wide,<br/>

  We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br/>

  Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00419">More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br/>

  Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br/>

  Were saying, "Who is this that without death<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00420">Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"<br/>

  And my sagacious Master made a sign<br/>

  Of wishing secretly to speak with them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00421">A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br/>

  And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone<br/>

  Who has so boldly entered these dominions.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00422">Let him return alone by his mad road;<br/>

  Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br/>

  Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00423">Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br/>

  At utterance of the accursed words;<br/>

  For never to return here I believed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00424">"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br/>

  Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br/>

  From imminent peril that before me stood,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00425">Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;<br/>

  And if the going farther be denied us,<br/>

  Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00426">And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage<br/>

  None can take from us, it by Such is given.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00427">But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br/>

  Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br/>

  For in this nether world I will not leave thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00428">So onward goes and there abandons me<br/>

  My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br/>

  For No and Yes within my head contend.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00429">I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br/>

  But with them there he did not linger long,<br/>

  Ere each within in rivalry ran back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00430">They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br/>

  On my Lord's breast, who had remained without<br/>

  And turned to me with footsteps far between.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00431">His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br/>

  Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br/>

  "Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00432">And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,<br/>

  Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br/>

  Whatever for defence within be planned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00433">This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br/>

  For once they used it at less secret gate,<br/>

  Which finds itself without a fastening still.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00434">O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br/>

  And now this side of it descends the steep,<br/>

  Passing across the circles without escort,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00435">One by whose means the city shall be opened."</p>
<p id="id00436" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto IX</p>
<p id="id00437" style="margin-top: 2em">That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br/>

  Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br/>

  Sooner repressed within him his new colour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00438">He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br/>

  Because the eye could not conduct him far<br/>

  Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00439">"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"<br/>

  Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br/>

  O how I long that some one here arrive!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00440">Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br/>

  He covered up with what came afterward,<br/>

  That they were words quite different from the first;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00441">But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br/>

  Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br/>

  Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00442">"Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br/>

  Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,<br/>

  Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00443">This question put I; and he answered me:<br/>

  "Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br/>

  Maketh the journey upon which I go.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00444">True is it, once before I here below<br/>

  Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br/>

  Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00445">Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br/>

  Before within that wall she made me enter,<br/>

  To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00446">That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br/>

  And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br/>

  Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00447">This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br/>

  Encompasses about the city dolent,<br/>

  Where now we cannot enter without anger."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00448">And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br/>

  Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br/>

  Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00449">Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br/>

  The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br/>

  Who had the limbs of women and their mien,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00450">And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br/>

  Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br/>

  Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00451">And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br/>

  Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00452">This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br/>

  She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br/>

  Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00453">Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br/>

  They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br/>

  That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00454">"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"<br/>

  All shouted looking down; "in evil hour<br/>

  Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00455">"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br/>

  For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br/>

  No more returning upward would there be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00456">Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br/>

  Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br/>

  So far as not to blind me with his own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00457">O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br/>

  Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br/>

  Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00458">And now there came across the turbid waves<br/>

  The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br/>

  Because of which both of the margins trembled;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00459">Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br/>

  Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br/>

  That smites the forest, and, without restraint,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00460">The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br/>

  Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br/>

  And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00461">Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve<br/>

  Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br/>

  There yonder where that smoke is most intense."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00462">Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br/>

  Across the water scatter all abroad,<br/>

  Until each one is huddled in the earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00463">More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br/>

  Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br/>

  Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00464">From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br/>

  Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br/>

  And only with that anguish seemed he weary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00465">Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br/>

  And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br/>

  That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00466">Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br/>

  He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br/>

  He opened it, for there was no resistance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00467">"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"<br/>

  Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br/>

  "Whence is this arrogance within you couched?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00468">Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br/>

  From which the end can never be cut off,<br/>

  And which has many times increased your pain?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00469">What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br/>

  Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br/>

  For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00470">Then he returned along the miry road,<br/>

  And spake no word to us, but had the look<br/>

  Of one whom other care constrains and goads<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00471">Than that of him who in his presence is;<br/>

  And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,<br/>

  After those holy words all confident.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00472">Within we entered without any contest;<br/>

  And I, who inclination had to see<br/>

  What the condition such a fortress holds,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00473">Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br/>

  And see on every hand an ample plain,<br/>

  Full of distress and torment terrible.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00474">Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br/>

  Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br/>

  That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00475">The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br/>

  So likewise did they there on every side,<br/>

  Saving that there the manner was more bitter;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00476">For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br/>

  By which they so intensely heated were,<br/>

  That iron more so asks not any art.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00477">All of their coverings uplifted were,<br/>

  And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br/>

  Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00478">And I: "My Master, what are all those people<br/>

  Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br/>

  Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00479">And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,<br/>

  With their disciples of all sects, and much<br/>

  More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00480">Here like together with its like is buried;<br/>

  And more and less the monuments are heated."<br/>

  And when he to the right had turned, we passed<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00481">Between the torments and high parapets.</p>
<p id="id00482" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto X</p>
<p id="id00483" style="margin-top: 2em">Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br/>

  Between the torments and the city wall,<br/>

  My Master, and I follow at his back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00484">"O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br/>

  Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,<br/>

  Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00485">The people who are lying in these tombs,<br/>

  Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br/>

  The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00486">And he to me: "They all will be closed up<br/>

  When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br/>

  Here with the bodies they have left above.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00487">Their cemetery have upon this side<br/>

  With Epicurus all his followers,<br/>

  Who with the body mortal make the soul;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00488">But in the question thou dost put to me,<br/>

  Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br/>

  And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00489">And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br/>

  From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br/>

  Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00490">"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br/>

  Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br/>

  Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00491">Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br/>

  A native of that noble fatherland,<br/>

  To which perhaps I too molestful was."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00492">Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br/>

  From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br/>

  Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00493">And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?<br/>

  Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br/>

  From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00494">I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br/>

  And he uprose erect with breast and front<br/>

  E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00495">And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br/>

  Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br/>

  Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00496">As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br/>

  Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br/>

  Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00497">I, who desirous of obeying was,<br/>

  Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br/>

  Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00498">Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been<br/>

  To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br/>

  So that two several times I scattered them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00499">"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"<br/>

  I answered him, "the first time and the second;<br/>

  But yours have not acquired that art aright."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00500">Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br/>

  Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br/>

  I think that he had risen on his knees.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00501">Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br/>

  He had to see if some one else were with me,<br/>

  But after his suspicion was all spent,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00502">Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind<br/>

  Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br/>

  Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00503">And I to him: "I come not of myself;<br/>

  He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br/>

  Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00504">His language and the mode of punishment<br/>

  Already unto me had read his name;<br/>

  On that account my answer was so full.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00505">Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How<br/>

  Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?<br/>

  Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00506">When he became aware of some delay,<br/>

  Which I before my answer made, supine<br/>

  He fell again, and forth appeared no more.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00507">But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br/>

  I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br/>

  Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00508">"And if," continuing his first discourse,<br/>

  "They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,<br/>

  That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00509">But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br/>

  The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br/>

  Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00510">And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br/>

  Say why that people is so pitiless<br/>

  Against my race in each one of its laws?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00511">Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage<br/>

  Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br/>

  Such orisons in our temple to be made."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00512">After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br/>

  "There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely<br/>

  Without a cause had with the others moved.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00513">But there I was alone, where every one<br/>

  Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br/>

  He who defended her with open face."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00514">"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"<br/>

  I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,<br/>

  Which has entangled my conceptions here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00515">It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br/>

  Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,<br/>

  And in the present have another mode."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00516">"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br/>

  The things," he said, "that distant are from us;<br/>

  So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00517">When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br/>

  Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br/>

  Not anything know we of your human state.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00518">Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br/>

  Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br/>

  The portal of the future shall be closed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00519">Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br/>

  Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br/>

  That still his son is with the living joined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00520">And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br/>

  Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br/>

  Already of the error you have solved me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00521">And now my Master was recalling me,<br/>

  Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br/>

  That he would tell me who was with him there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00522">He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;<br/>

  Within here is the second Frederick,<br/>

  And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00523">Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br/>

  The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br/>

  Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00524">He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br/>

  He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"<br/>

  And I in his inquiry satisfied him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00525">"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br/>

  Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,<br/>

  "And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00526">"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br/>

  Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br/>

  From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00527">Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br/>

  We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br/>

  Along a path that strikes into a valley,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00528">Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>
<p id="id00529" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XI</p>
<p id="id00530" style="margin-top: 2em">Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br/>

  Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br/>

  We came upon a still more cruel throng;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00531">And there, by reason of the horrible<br/>

  Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br/>

  We drew ourselves aside behind the cover<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00532">Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br/>

  Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,<br/>

  Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00533">"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br/>

  So that the sense be first a little used<br/>

  To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00534">The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br/>

  "Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br/>

  Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00535">My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"<br/>

  Began he then to say, "are three small circles,<br/>

  From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00536">They all are full of spirits maledict;<br/>

  But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br/>

  Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00537">Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br/>

  Injury is the end; and all such end<br/>

  Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00538">But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br/>

  More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br/>

  The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00539">All the first circle of the Violent is;<br/>

  But since force may be used against three persons,<br/>

  In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00540">To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br/>

  Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br/>

  As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00541">A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br/>

  Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br/>

  Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00542">Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br/>

  Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br/>

  Tormenteth all in companies diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00543">Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br/>

  And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br/>

  Round must perforce without avail repent<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00544">Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br/>

  Who games, and dissipates his property,<br/>

  And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00545">Violence can be done the Deity,<br/>

  In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br/>

  And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00546">And for this reason doth the smallest round<br/>

  Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br/>

  And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00547">Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br/>

  A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br/>

  And him who doth no confidence imburse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00548">This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br/>

  Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br/>

  Wherefore within the second circle nestle<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00549">Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br/>

  Falsification, theft, and simony,<br/>

  Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00550">By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br/>

  Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br/>

  From which there is a special faith engendered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00551">Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br/>

  Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br/>

  Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00552">And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds<br/>

  Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br/>

  This cavern and the people who possess it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00553">But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br/>

  Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br/>

  And who encounter with such bitter tongues,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00554">Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br/>

  Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br/>

  And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00555">And unto me he said: "Why wanders so<br/>

  Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br/>

  Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00556">Hast thou no recollection of those words<br/>

  With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br/>

  The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00557">Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br/>

  Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br/>

  Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00558">If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br/>

  And to thy mind recallest who they are<br/>

  That up outside are undergoing penance,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00559">Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br/>

  They separated are, and why less wroth<br/>

  Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00560">"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br/>

  Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br/>

  That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00561">Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,<br/>

  "There where thou sayest that usury offends<br/>

  Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00562">"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,<br/>

  Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br/>

  After what manner Nature takes her course<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00563">From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br/>

  And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br/>

  After not many pages shalt thou find,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00564">That this your art as far as possible<br/>

  Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br/>

  So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00565">From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br/>

  Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br/>

  Mankind to gain their life and to advance;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00566">And since the usurer takes another way,<br/>

  Nature herself and in her follower<br/>

  Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00567">But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br/>

  For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br/>

  And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,<br/>

<p id="id00568">And far beyond there we descend the crag."</p>
<p id="id00569" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XII</p>
<p id="id00570" style="margin-top: 2em">The place where to descend the bank we came<br/>

  Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br/>

  Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00571">Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br/>

  Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<br/>

  Either by earthquake or by failing stay,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00572">For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,<br/>

  Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br/>

  Some path 'twould give to him who was above;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00573">Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br/>

  And on the border of the broken chasm<br/>

  The infamy of Crete was stretched along,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00574">Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br/>

  And when he us beheld, he bit himself,<br/>

  Even as one whom anger racks within.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00575">My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure<br/>

  Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br/>

<p id="id00576">Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br/>

  Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br/>

<p id="id00577">As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br/>

  And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;<br/>

  While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00579">Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge<br/>

  Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br/>

  Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00580">Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking<br/>

<p id="id00582">But truly, if I well discern, a little<br/>

  Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br/>

<p id="id00583">Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br/>

<p id="id00592">Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,<br/>

  Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br/>

  And for himself, himself did vengeance take.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00593">And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br/>

  Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br/>

  That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00594">Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br/>

  Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br/>

  Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00595">Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br/>

  Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br/>

  Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00596">After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br/>

  He said to his companions: "Are you ware<br/>

  That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00597">Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."<br/>

  And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br/>

  Where the two natures are together joined,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00598">Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br/>

  Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br/>

  Necessity, and not delight, impels us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00599">Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br/>

  Who unto me committed this new office;<br/>

  No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00600">But by that virtue through which I am moving<br/>

  My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br/>

  Give us some one of thine, to be with us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00601">And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br/>

  And who may carry this one on his back;<br/>

  For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00602">Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br/>

  And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,<br/>

  And warn aside, if other band may meet you."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00603">We with our faithful escort onward moved<br/>

  Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br/>

  Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00604">People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br/>

  And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,<br/>

  Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00605">Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br/>

  Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br/>

  Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00606">That forehead there which has the hair so black<br/>

  Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br/>

  Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00607">Up in the world was by his stepson slain."<br/>

  Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br/>

  "Now he be first to thee, and second I."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00608">A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br/>

  Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br/>

  Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00609">A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br/>

  Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom<br/>

  The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00610">Then people saw I, who from out the river<br/>

  Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br/>

  And many among these I recognised.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00611">Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br/>

  That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br/>

  And there across the moat our passage was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00612">"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br/>

  The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"<br/>

  The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00613">That on this other more and more declines<br/>

  Its bed, until it reunites itself<br/>

  Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00614">Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br/>

  That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br/>

  And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00615">The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br/>

  In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br/>

  Who made upon the highways so much war."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00616">Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>
<p id="id00617" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIII</p>
<p id="id00618" style="margin-top: 2em">Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br/>

  When we had put ourselves within a wood,<br/>

  That was not marked by any path whatever.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00619">Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br/>

  Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br/>

  Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00620">Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br/>

  Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br/>

  'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00621">There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,<br/>

  Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,<br/>

  With sad announcement of impending doom;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00622">Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,<br/>

  And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;<br/>

  They make laments upon the wondrous trees.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00623">And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,<br/>

  Know that thou art within the second round,"<br/>

  Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00624">Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;<br/>

  Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see<br/>

  Things that will credence give unto my speech."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00625">I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,<br/>

  And person none beheld I who might make them,<br/>

  Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00626">I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br/>

  So many voices issued through those trunks<br/>

  From people who concealed themselves from us;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00627">Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off<br/>

  Some little spray from any of these trees,<br/>

  The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00628">Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br/>

  And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br/>

  And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00629">After it had become embrowned with blood,<br/>

  It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?<br/>

  Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00630">Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br/>

  Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br/>

  Even if the souls of serpents we had been."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00631">As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br/>

  At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br/>

  And hisses with the wind that is escaping;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00632">So from that splinter issued forth together<br/>

  Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br/>

  Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00633">"Had he been able sooner to believe,"<br/>

  My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,<br/>

  What only in my verses he has seen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00634">Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br/>

  Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br/>

  To put him to an act which grieveth me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00635">But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br/>

  Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br/>

  Up in the world, to which he can return."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00636">And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,<br/>

  I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br/>

  That I a little to discourse am tempted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00637">I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br/>

  Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro<br/>

  So softly in unlocking and in locking,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00638">That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br/>

  Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br/>

  So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00639">The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br/>

  Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br/>

  Death universal and the vice of courts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00640">Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br/>

  And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br/>

  That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00641">My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br/>

  Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br/>

  Made me unjust against myself, the just.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00642">I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br/>

  Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br/>

  Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00643">And to the world if one of you return,<br/>

  Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br/>

  Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00644">Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"<br/>

  The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,<br/>

  But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00645">Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire<br/>

  Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;<br/>

  For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00646">Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man<br/>

  Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br/>

  Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00647">To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br/>

  Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br/>

  If any from such members e'er is freed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00648">Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br/>

  The wind was into such a voice converted:<br/>

  "With brevity shall be replied to you.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00649">When the exasperated soul abandons<br/>

  The body whence it rent itself away,<br/>

  Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00650">It falls into the forest, and no part<br/>

  Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br/>

  There like a grain of spelt it germinates.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00651">It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br/>

  The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br/>

  Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00652">Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br/>

  But not that any one may them revest,<br/>

  For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00653">Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br/>

  Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br/>

  Each to the thorn of his molested shade."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00654">We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br/>

  Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br/>

  When by a tumult we were overtaken,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00655">In the same way as he is who perceives<br/>

  The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br/>

  Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00656">And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br/>

  Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br/>

  That of the forest, every fan they broke.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00657">He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"<br/>

  And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br/>

  Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00658">Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"<br/>

  And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br/>

  He grouped himself together with a bush.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00659">Behind them was the forest full of black<br/>

  She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br/>

  As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00660">On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br/>

  And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br/>

  Thereafter bore away those aching members.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00661">Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br/>

  And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br/>

  Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00662">"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,<br/>

  What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br/>

  What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00663">When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br/>

  He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br/>

  Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00664">And he to us: "O souls, that hither come<br/>

  To look upon the shameful massacre<br/>

  That has so rent away from me my leaves,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00665">Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br/>

  I of that city was which to the Baptist<br/>

  Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00666">Forever with his art will make it sad.<br/>

  And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br/>

  Some glimpses of him are remaining still,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00667">Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br/>

  Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br/>

  In vain had caused their labour to be done.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00668">Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</p>
<p id="id00669" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XIV</p>
<p id="id00670" style="margin-top: 2em">Because the charity of my native place<br/>

  Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br/>

  And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00671">Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br/>

  The second round is from the third, and where<br/>

  A horrible form of Justice is beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00672">Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br/>

  I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br/>

  Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00673">The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br/>

  All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br/>

  There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00674">The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br/>

  Not of another fashion made than that<br/>

  Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00675">Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br/>

  By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br/>

  That which was manifest unto mine eyes!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00676">Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br/>

  Who all were weeping very miserably,<br/>

  And over them seemed set a law diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00677">Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br/>

  And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br/>

  And others went about continually.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00678">Those who were going round were far the more,<br/>

  And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br/>

  But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00679">O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br/>

  Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br/>

  As of the snow on Alp without a wind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00680">As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br/>

  Of India, beheld upon his host<br/>

  Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00681">Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br/>

  To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br/>

  Better extinguished was while it was single;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00682">Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br/>

  Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br/>

  Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00683">Without repose forever was the dance<br/>

  Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br/>

  Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00684">"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest<br/>

  All things except the demons dire, that issued<br/>

  Against us at the entrance of the gate,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00685">Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br/>

  The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br/>

  So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00686">And he himself, who had become aware<br/>

  That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br/>

  Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00687">If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br/>

  He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br/>

  Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00688">And if he wearied out by turns the others<br/>

  In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br/>

  Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00689">Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br/>

  And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br/>

  He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00690">Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br/>

  That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br/>

  "O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00691">Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br/>

  Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br/>

  Would be unto thy fury pain complete."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00692">Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br/>

  Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he<br/>

  Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00693">God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br/>

  But, as I said to him, his own despites<br/>

  Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00694">Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br/>

  As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br/>

  But always keep them close unto the wood."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00695">Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br/>

  Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br/>

  Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00696">As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br/>

  The sinful women later share among them,<br/>

  So downward through the sand it went its way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00697">The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br/>

  Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br/>

  Whence I perceived that there the passage was.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00698">"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br/>

  Since we have entered in within the gate<br/>

  Whose threshold unto no one is denied,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00699">Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br/>

  So notable as is the present river,<br/>

  Which all the little flames above it quenches."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00700">These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br/>

  That he would give me largess of the food,<br/>

  For which he had given me largess of desire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00701">"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"<br/>

  Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,<br/>

  Under whose king the world of old was chaste.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00702">There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br/>

  With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br/>

  Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00703">Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br/>

  Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br/>

  Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00704">A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br/>

  Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,<br/>

  And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00705">His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br/>

  And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br/>

  Then he is brass as far down as the fork.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00706">From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br/>

  Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br/>

  And more he stands on that than on the other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00707">Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br/>

  Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br/>

  Which gathered together perforate that cavern.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00708">From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br/>

  Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br/>

  Then downward go along this narrow sluice<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00709">Unto that point where is no more descending.<br/>

  They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br/>

  Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00710">And I to him: "If so the present runnel<br/>

  Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br/>

  Why only on this verge appears it to us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00711">And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,<br/>

  And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br/>

  Still to the left descending to the bottom,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00712">Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br/>

  Therefore if something new appear to us,<br/>

  It should not bring amazement to thy face."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00713">And I again: "Master, where shall be found<br/>

  Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,<br/>

  And sayest the other of this rain is made?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00714">"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"<br/>

  Replied he; "but the boiling of the red<br/>

  Water might well solve one of them thou makest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00715">Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br/>

  There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br/>

  When sin repented of has been removed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00716">Then said he: "It is time now to abandon<br/>

  The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br/>

  A way the margins make that are not burning,<br/>

<p id="id00717">And over them all vapours are extinguished."</p>

</p>
<p id="id00720">Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br/>

  Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,<br/>

  Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00721">And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br/>

  To guard their villas and their villages,<br/>

  Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00722">In such similitude had those been made,<br/>

  Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br/>

  Whoever he might be, the master made them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00723">Now were we from the forest so remote,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00725">To eye each other under a new moon,<br/>

  And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br/>

  As an old tailor at the needle's eye.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00726">Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br/>

  By some one I was recognised, who seized<br/>

  My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00727">And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br/>

  On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br/>

  That the scorched countenance prevented not<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00728">His recognition by my intellect;<br/>

  And bowing down my face unto his own,<br/>

  I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00729">And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,<br/>

  If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br/>

  Backward return and let the trail go on."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00730">I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;<br/>

  And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br/>

  I will, if he please, for I go with him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00731">"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd<br/>

  A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br/>

  Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00732">Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br/>

  And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br/>

  Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00733">I did not dare to go down from the road<br/>

  Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br/>

  I held as one who goeth reverently.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00734">And he began: "What fortune or what fate<br/>

  Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br/>

  And who is this that showeth thee the way?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00735">"Up there above us in the life serene,"<br/>

  I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,<br/>

  Or ever yet my age had been completed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00736">But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br/>

  This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br/>

  And homeward leadeth me along this road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00737">And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,<br/>

  Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br/>

  If well I judged in the life beautiful.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00738">And if I had not died so prematurely,<br/>

  Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br/>

  I would have given thee comfort in the work.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00739">But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br/>

  Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br/>

  And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00740">Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br/>

  And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br/>

  It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00741">Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br/>

  A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br/>

  Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00742">Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br/>

  One party and the other shall be hungry<br/>

  For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00743">Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br/>

  Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br/>

  If any still upon their dunghill rise,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00744">In which may yet revive the consecrated<br/>

  Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br/>

  The nest of such great malice it became."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00745">"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"<br/>

  Replied I to him, "not yet would you be<br/>

  In banishment from human nature placed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00746">For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br/>

  My heart the dear and good paternal image<br/>

  Of you, when in the world from hour to hour<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00747">You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br/>

  And how much I am grateful, while I live<br/>

  Behoves that in my language be discerned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00748">What you narrate of my career I write,<br/>

  And keep it to be glossed with other text<br/>

  By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00749">This much will I have manifest to you;<br/>

  Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br/>

  For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00750">Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br/>

  Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br/>

  As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00751">My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br/>

  Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br/>

  Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00752">Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br/>

  With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br/>

  His most known and most eminent companions.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00753">And he to me: "To know of some is well;<br/>

  Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br/>

  For short would be the time for so much speech.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00754">Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br/>

  And men of letters great and of great fame,<br/>

  In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00755">Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br/>

  And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br/>

  If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00756">That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br/>

  From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br/>

  Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00757">More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br/>

  Can be no longer; for that I behold<br/>

  New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00758">A people comes with whom I may not be;<br/>

  Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br/>

  In which I still live, and no more I ask."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00759">Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br/>

  Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br/>

  Across the plain; and seemed to be among them<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00760">The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>
<p id="id00761" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVI</p>
<p id="id00762" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br/>

  Of water falling into the next round,<br/>

  Like to that humming which the beehives make,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00763">When shadows three together started forth,<br/>

  Running, from out a company that passed<br/>

  Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00764">Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br/>

  "Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br/>

  To be some one of our depraved city."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00765">Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br/>

  Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!<br/>

  It pains me still but to remember it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00766">Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br/>

  He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"<br/>

  He said; "to these we should be courteous.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00767">And if it were not for the fire that darts<br/>

  The nature of this region, I should say<br/>

  That haste were more becoming thee than them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00768">As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br/>

  The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br/>

  Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00769">As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br/>

  Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br/>

  Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00770">Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br/>

  Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br/>

  His neck and feet continual journey made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00771">And, "If the misery of this soft place<br/>

  Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"<br/>

  Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00772">Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br/>

  To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br/>

  Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00773">He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br/>

  Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br/>

  Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00774">He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br/>

  His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br/>

  Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00775">The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br/>

  Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br/>

  Above there in the world should welcome be.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00776">And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br/>

  Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br/>

  My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00777">Could I have been protected from the fire,<br/>

  Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br/>

  And think the Teacher would have suffered it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00778">But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br/>

  My terror overmastered my good will,<br/>

  Which made me greedy of embracing them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00779">Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain<br/>

  Did your condition fix within me so,<br/>

  That tardily it wholly is stripped off,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00780">As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br/>

  Words, on account of which I thought within me<br/>

  That people such as you are were approaching.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00781">I of your city am; and evermore<br/>

  Your labours and your honourable names<br/>

  I with affection have retraced and heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00782">I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br/>

  Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br/>

  But to the centre first I needs must plunge."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00783">"So may the soul for a long while conduct<br/>

  Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,<br/>

  "And so may thy renown shine after thee,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00784">Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br/>

  Within our city, as they used to do,<br/>

  Or if they wholly have gone out of it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00785">For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br/>

  With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br/>

  Doth greatly mortify us with his words."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00786">"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br/>

  Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br/>

  Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00787">In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br/>

  And the three, taking that for my reply,<br/>

  Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00788">"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"<br/>

  Replied they all, "to satisfy another,<br/>

  Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00789">Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br/>

  And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br/>

  When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00790">See that thou speak of us unto the people."<br/>

  Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br/>

  It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00791">Not an Amen could possibly be said<br/>

  So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br/>

  Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00792">I followed him, and little had we gone,<br/>

  Before the sound of water was so near us,<br/>

  That speaking we should hardly have been heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00793">Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br/>

  The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,<br/>

  Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00794">Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br/>

  It down descendeth into its low bed,<br/>

  And at Forli is vacant of that name,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00795">Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br/>

  From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br/>

  Where for a thousand there were room enough;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00796">Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br/>

  We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br/>

  So that it soon the ear would have offended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00797">I had a cord around about me girt,<br/>

  And therewithal I whilom had designed<br/>

  To take the panther with the painted skin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00798">After I this had all from me unloosed,<br/>

  As my Conductor had commanded me,<br/>

  I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00799">Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br/>

  And at a little distance from the verge,<br/>

  He cast it down into that deep abyss.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00800">"It must needs be some novelty respond,"<br/>

  I said within myself, "to the new signal<br/>

  The Master with his eye is following so."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00801">Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br/>

  With those who not alone behold the act,<br/>

  But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00802">He said to me: "Soon there will upward come<br/>

  What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br/>

  Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00803">Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br/>

  A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br/>

  Because without his fault it causes shame;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00804">But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br/>

  Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br/>

  So may they not be void of lasting favour,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00805">Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br/>

  I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br/>

  Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00806">Even as he returns who goeth down<br/>

  Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br/>

  Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00807">Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>
<p id="id00808" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVII</p>
<p id="id00809" style="margin-top: 2em">"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br/>

  Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br/>

  Behold him who infecteth all the world."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00810">Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br/>

  And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br/>

  Near to the confine of the trodden marble;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00811">And that uncleanly image of deceit<br/>

  Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br/>

  But on the border did not drag its tail.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00812">The face was as the face of a just man,<br/>

  Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br/>

  And of a serpent all the trunk beside.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00813">Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br/>

  The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br/>

  Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00814">With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br/>

  Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br/>

  Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00815">As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br/>

  That part are in the water, part on land;<br/>

  And as among the guzzling Germans there,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00816">The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br/>

  So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br/>

  Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00817">His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br/>

  Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br/>

  That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00818">The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside<br/>

  Our way a little, even to that beast<br/>

  Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00819">We therefore on the right side descended,<br/>

  And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br/>

  Completely to avoid the sand and flame;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00820">And after we are come to him, I see<br/>

  A little farther off upon the sand<br/>

  A people sitting near the hollow place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00821">Then said to me the Master: "So that full<br/>

  Experience of this round thou bear away,<br/>

  Now go and see what their condition is.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00822">There let thy conversation be concise;<br/>

  Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br/>

  That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00823">Thus farther still upon the outermost<br/>

  Head of that seventh circle all alone<br/>

  I went, where sat the melancholy folk.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00824">Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br/>

  This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br/>

  Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00825">Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br/>

  Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br/>

  By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00826">When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br/>

  Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br/>

  Not one of them I knew; but I perceived<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00827">That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br/>

  Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br/>

  And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00828">And as I gazing round me come among them,<br/>

  Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br/>

  That had the face and posture of a lion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00829">Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br/>

  Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br/>

  Display a goose more white than butter is.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00830">And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br/>

  Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br/>

  Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00831">Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,<br/>

  Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br/>

  Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00832">A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br/>

  Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br/>

  Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00833">He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"<br/>

  Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br/>

  His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00834">And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br/>

  Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br/>

  Backward I turned me from those weary souls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00835">I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br/>

  Upon the back of that wild animal,<br/>

  And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00836">Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br/>

  Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br/>

  So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00837">Such as he is who has so near the ague<br/>

  Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br/>

  And trembles all, but looking at the shade;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00838">Even such became I at those proffered words;<br/>

  But shame in me his menaces produced,<br/>

  Which maketh servant strong before good master.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00839">I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br/>

  I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br/>

  As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00840">But he, who other times had rescued me<br/>

  In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br/>

  Within his arms encircled and sustained me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00841">And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br/>

  The circles large, and the descent be little;<br/>

  Think of the novel burden which thou hast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00842">Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br/>

  Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br/>

  And when he wholly felt himself afloat,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00843">There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br/>

  And that extended like an eel he moved,<br/>

  And with his paws drew to himself the air.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00844">A greater fear I do not think there was<br/>

  What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br/>

  Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00845">Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br/>

  Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br/>

  His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00846">Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br/>

  On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br/>

  The sight of everything but of the monster.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00847">Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br/>

  Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br/>

  By wind upon my face and from below.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00848">I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br/>

  Making a horrible crashing under us;<br/>

  Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00849">Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br/>

  Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br/>

  Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00850">I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br/>

  The turning and descending, by great horrors<br/>

  That were approaching upon divers sides.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00851">As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br/>

  Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br/>

  Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00852">Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br/>

  Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br/>

  Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00853">Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br/>

  Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br/>

  And being disencumbered of our persons,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00854">He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>
<p id="id00855" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XVIII</p>
<p id="id00856" style="margin-top: 2em">There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br/>

  Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br/>

  And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00859">As where for the protection of the walls<br/>

  Many and many moats surround the castles,<br/>

  The part in which they are a figure forms,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00860">Just such an image those presented there;<br/>

  And as about such strongholds from their gates<br/>

  Unto the outer bank are little bridges,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00861">So from the precipice's base did crags<br/>

  Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br/>

  Unto the well that truncates and collects them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00862">Within this place, down shaken from the back<br/>

  Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br/>

  Held to the left, and I moved on behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00863">Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br/>

  New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br/>

  Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00864">Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br/>

  This side the middle came they facing us,<br/>

  Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00865">Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br/>

  The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br/>

  Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00866">For all upon one side towards the Castle<br/>

  Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;<br/>

  On the other side they go towards the Mountain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00867">This side and that, along the livid stone<br/>

  Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br/>

  Who cruelly were beating them behind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00868">Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br/>

  At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br/>

  The second waited for, nor for the third.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00869">While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br/>

  Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already<br/>

  With sight of this one I am not unfed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00870">Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br/>

  And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br/>

  And to my going somewhat back assented;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00871">And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br/>

  Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br/>

  For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00872">If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br/>

  Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br/>

  But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00873">And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;<br/>

  But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br/>

  Which makes me recollect the ancient world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00874">I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br/>

  Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br/>

  Howe'er the shameless story may be told.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00875">Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br/>

  Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br/>

  That not so many tongues to-day are taught<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00876">'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'<br/>

  And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br/>

  Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00877">While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br/>

  A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone<br/>

  Pander, there are no women here for coin."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00878">I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br/>

  Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br/>

  To where a crag projected from the bank.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00879">This very easily did we ascend,<br/>

  And turning to the right along its ridge,<br/>

  From those eternal circles we departed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00880">When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br/>

  Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br/>

  The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00881">The vision of those others evil-born,<br/>

  Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br/>

  Because together with us they have gone."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00882">From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br/>

  Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,<br/>

  And which the scourges in like manner smite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00883">And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br/>

  Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,<br/>

  And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00884">Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br/>

  That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br/>

  The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00885">He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br/>

  After the daring women pitiless<br/>

  Had unto death devoted all their males.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00886">There with his tokens and with ornate words<br/>

  Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br/>

  Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00887">There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br/>

  Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br/>

  And also for Medea is vengeance done.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00888">With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br/>

  And this sufficient be of the first valley<br/>

  To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00889">We were already where the narrow path<br/>

  Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br/>

  Of that a buttress for another arch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00890">Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br/>

  In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br/>

  And with their palms beating upon themselves<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00891">The margins were incrusted with a mould<br/>

  By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br/>

  And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00892">The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br/>

  To give us sight of it, without ascending<br/>

  The arch's back, where most the crag impends.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00893">Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br/>

  I saw a people smothered in a filth<br/>

  That out of human privies seemed to flow;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00894">And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br/>

  I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br/>

  It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00895">He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager<br/>

  To look at me more than the other foul ones?"<br/>

  And I to him: "Because, if I remember,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00896">I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br/>

  And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br/>

  Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00897">And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br/>

  "The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br/>

  Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00898">Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust<br/>

  Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br/>

  That with thine eyes thou well the face attain<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00899">Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br/>

  Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br/>

  And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00900">Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br/>

  Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I<br/>

  Great gratitude from thee?'—'Nay, marvellous;'<br/>
</p>

  Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,<br/>

<p id="id00905">We had already on the following tomb<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00910">Out of the mouth of each one there protruded<br/>

  The feet of a transgressor, and the legs<br/>

  Up to the calf, the rest within remained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00911">In all of them the soles were both on fire;<br/>

  Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,<br/>

  They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00912">Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont<br/>

  To move upon the outer surface only,<br/>

  So likewise was it there from heel to point.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00913">"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,<br/>

  More than his other comrades quivering,"<br/>

  I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00914">And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee<br/>

<p id="id00915">And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;<br/>

  Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not<br/>

  From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00916">Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;<br/>

  We turned, and on the left-hand side descended<br/>

  Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00917">And the good Master yet from off his haunch<br/>

  Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00918">"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,<br/>

  O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"<br/>

  To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00919">I stood even as the friar who is confessing<br/>

  The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<br/>

  Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00920">And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,<br/>

  Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<br/>

  By many years the record lied to me.<br/>

<p id="id00921">Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,<br/>

  For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud<br/>

  The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00922">Such I became, as people are who stand,<br/>

  Not comprehending what is answered them,<br/>

  As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00923">Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,<br/>

  'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"<br/>

  And I replied as was imposed on me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00924">Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,<br/>

  Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation<br/>

  Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?<br/>

<p id="id00927">Beneath my head the others are dragged down<br/>

<p id="id00931">New Jason will he be, of whom we read<br/>

  In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,<br/>

  So he who governs France shall be to this one."<br/>

  Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00935">Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,<br/>

  And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,<br/>

  Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00936">And were it not that still forbids it me<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00942">And while I sang to him such notes as these,<br/>

  Either that anger or that conscience stung him,<br/>

  He struggled violently with both his feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00943">I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,<br/>

  With such contented lip he listened ever<br/>

  Unto the sound of the true words expressed.<br/>

  Remounted by the way where he descended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00945">Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;<br/>

  But bore me to the summit of the arch<br/>

  Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.<br/>

<p id="id00946">There tenderly he laid his burden down,<br/>

  Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,<br/>

  Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00991">And yesternight the moon was round already;<br/>

  Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br/>

  From time to time within the forest deep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00992">Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>
<p id="id00993" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXI</p>
<p id="id00994" style="margin-top: 2em">From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br/>

  Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br/>

  We came along, and held the summit, when<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00995">We halted to behold another fissure<br/>

  Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br/>

  And I beheld it marvellously dark.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00996">As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br/>

  Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br/>

  To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00997">For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br/>

  One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br/>

  The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00998">One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br/>

  This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br/>

  Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00999">Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br/>

  Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br/>

  Which upon every side the bank belimed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01000">I saw it, but I did not see within it<br/>

  Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br/>

  And all swell up and resubside compressed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01001">The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br/>

  My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"<br/>

  Drew me unto himself from where I stood.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01002">Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br/>

  To see what it behoves him to escape,<br/>

  And whom a sudden terror doth unman,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01003">Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br/>

  And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br/>

  Running along upon the crag, approach.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01004">Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br/>

  And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br/>

  With open wings and light upon his feet!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01005">His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br/>

  A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br/>

  And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01006">From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,<br/>

  Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br/>

  Plunge him beneath, for I return for others<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01007">Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br/>

  All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br/>

  No into Yes for money there is changed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01008">He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br/>

  Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br/>

  In so much hurry to pursue a thief.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01009">The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br/>

  But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br/>

  Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01010">Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br/>

  Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br/>

  Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01011">They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br/>

  They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br/>

  That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01012">Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br/>

  Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br/>

  The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01013">Said the good Master to me: "That it be not<br/>

  Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br/>

  Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01014">And for no outrage that is done to me<br/>

  Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br/>

  For once before was I in such a scuffle."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01015">Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,<br/>

  And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br/>

  Need was for him to have a steadfast front.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01016">With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br/>

  As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br/>

  Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01017">They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br/>

  And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br/>

  But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01018">Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br/>

  Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br/>

  And then take counsel as to grappling me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01019">They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"<br/>

  Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br/>

  And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01020">"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br/>

  Advanced into this place," my Master said,<br/>

  "Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01021">Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br/>

  Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br/>

  That I another show this savage road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01022">Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br/>

  That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br/>

  And to the others said: "Now strike him not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01023">And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest<br/>

  Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br/>

  Securely now return to me again."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01024">Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br/>

  And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br/>

  So that I feared they would not keep their compact.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01025">And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br/>

  Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br/>

  Seeing themselves among so many foes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01026">Close did I press myself with all my person<br/>

  Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br/>

  From off their countenance, which was not good.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01027">They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"<br/>

  They said to one another, "on the rump?"<br/>

  And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01028">But the same demon who was holding parley<br/>

  With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br/>

  And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01029">Then said to us: "You can no farther go<br/>

  Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br/>

  All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01030">And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br/>

  Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br/>

  Near is another crag that yields a path.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01031">Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br/>

  One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br/>

  Years were complete, that here the way was broken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01032">I send in that direction some of mine<br/>

  To see if any one doth air himself;<br/>

  Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01033">Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"<br/>

  Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;<br/>

  And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01034">Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br/>

  And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br/>

  And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01035">Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br/>

  Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br/>

  That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01036">"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br/>

  Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,<br/>

  If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01037">If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br/>

  Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br/>

  And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01038">And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;<br/>

  Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br/>

  Because they do it for those boiling wretches."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01039">Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br/>

  But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br/>

  His teeth towards their leader for a signal;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01040">And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>
<p id="id01041" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXII</p>
<p id="id01042" style="margin-top: 2em">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br/>

  Begin the storming, and their muster make,<br/>

  And sometimes starting off for their escape;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01043">Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br/>

  O Aretines, and foragers go forth,<br/>

  Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01044">Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,<br/>

  With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,<br/>

  And with our own, and with outlandish things,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01045">But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth<br/>

  Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,<br/>

  Nor ship by any sign of land or star.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01046">We went upon our way with the ten demons;<br/>

  Ah, savage company! but in the church<br/>

  With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01047">Ever upon the pitch was my intent,<br/>

  To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,<br/>

  And of the people who therein were burned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01048">Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign<br/>

  To mariners by arching of the back,<br/>

  That they should counsel take to save their vessel,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01049">Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,<br/>

  One of the sinners would display his back,<br/>

  And in less time conceal it than it lightens.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01050">As on the brink of water in a ditch<br/>

  The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,<br/>

  So that they hide their feet and other bulk,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01051">So upon every side the sinners stood;<br/>

  But ever as Barbariccia near them came,<br/>

  Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01052">I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br/>

  One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br/>

  One frog remains, and down another dives;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01053">And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br/>

  Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br/>

  And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01054">I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br/>

  So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br/>

  And when they called each other, listened how.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01055">"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br/>

  Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"<br/>

  Cried all together the accursed ones.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01056">And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br/>

  That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br/>

  Thus come into his adversaries' hands."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01057">Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br/>

  Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br/>

  "I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01058">My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br/>

  For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br/>

  Destroyer of himself and of his things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01059">Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br/>

  I set me there to practise barratry,<br/>

  For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01060">And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br/>

  On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br/>

  Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01061">Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br/>

  But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br/>

  And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01062">And to my Master he turned round his head;<br/>

  "Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish<br/>

  To know from him, before some one destroy him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01063">The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;<br/>

  Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br/>

  Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01064">Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br/>

  Would that I still were covered up with him,<br/>

  For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01065">And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"<br/>

  And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br/>

  So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01066">Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br/>

  Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br/>

  Turned round and round about with evil look.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01067">When they again somewhat were pacified,<br/>

  Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br/>

  Demanded my Conductor without stay:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01068">"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br/>

  Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"<br/>

  And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01069">He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br/>

  Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br/>

  And dealt so with them each exults thereat;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01070">Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br/>

  As he says; and in other offices<br/>

  A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01071">Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br/>

  Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br/>

  To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01072">O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br/>

  Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br/>

  Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01073">And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br/>

  Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br/>

  Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01074">"If you desire either to see or hear,"<br/>

  The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br/>

  "Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01075">But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br/>

  So that these may not their revenges fear,<br/>

  And I, down sitting in this very place,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01076">For one that I am will make seven come,<br/>

  When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br/>

  To do whenever one of us comes out."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01077">Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br/>

  Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick<br/>

  Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01078">Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br/>

  Responded: "I by far too cunning am,<br/>

  When I procure for mine a greater sadness."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01079">Alichin held not in, but running counter<br/>

  Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,<br/>

  I will not follow thee upon the gallop,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01080">But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br/>

  The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br/>

  To see if thou alone dost countervail us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01081">O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br/>

  Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br/>

  He first, who most reluctant was to do it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01082">The Navarrese selected well his time;<br/>

  Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br/>

  Leaped, and released himself from their design.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01083">Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br/>

  But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br/>

  Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01084">But little it availed, for wings could not<br/>

  Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br/>

  And, flying, upward he his breast directed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01085">Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br/>

  Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br/>

  And upward he returneth cross and weary.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01086">Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br/>

  Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br/>

  The other should escape, to have a quarrel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01087">And when the barrator had disappeared,<br/>

  He turned his talons upon his companion,<br/>

  And grappled with him right above the moat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01088">But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br/>

  To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br/>

  Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01089">A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br/>

  But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,<br/>

  To such degree they had their wings belimed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01090">Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br/>

  Made four of them fly to the other side<br/>

  With all their gaffs, and very speedily<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01091">This side and that they to their posts descended;<br/>

  They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br/>

  Who were already baked within the crust,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01092">And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>
<p id="id01093" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIII</p>
<p id="id01094" style="margin-top: 2em">Silent, alone, and without company<br/>

  We went, the one in front, the other after,<br/>

  As go the Minor Friars along their way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01095">Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br/>

  My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br/>

  Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01096">For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike<br/>

  Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br/>

  End and beginning with a steadfast mind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01097">And even as one thought from another springs,<br/>

  So afterward from that was born another,<br/>

  Which the first fear within me double made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01098">Thus did I ponder: "These on our account<br/>

  Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br/>

  So great, that much I think it must annoy them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01099">If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br/>

  They will come after us more merciless<br/>

  Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01100">I felt my hair stand all on end already<br/>

  With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br/>

  When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01101">Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br/>

  I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br/>

  I so imagine them, I already feel them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01102">And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,<br/>

  Thine outward image I should not attract<br/>

  Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01103">Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br/>

  With similar attitude and similar face,<br/>

  So that of both one counsel sole I made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01104">If peradventure the right bank so slope<br/>

  That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br/>

  We shall escape from the imagined chase."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01105">Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br/>

  When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br/>

  Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01106">My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br/>

  Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br/>

  And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01107">Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br/>

  Having more care of him than of herself,<br/>

  So that she clothes her only with a shift;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01108">And downward from the top of the hard bank<br/>

  Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br/>

  That one side of the other Bolgia walls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01109">Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br/>

  To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br/>

  When nearest to the paddles it approaches,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01110">As did my Master down along that border,<br/>

  Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br/>

  As his own son, and not as a companion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01111">Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br/>

  His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br/>

  Right over us; but he was not afraid;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01112">For the high Providence, which had ordained<br/>

  To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br/>

  The power of thence departing took from all.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01113">A painted people there below we found,<br/>

  Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br/>

  Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01114">They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br/>

  Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br/>

  That in Cologne they for the monks are made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01115">Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br/>

  But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br/>

  That Frederick used to put them on of straw.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01116">O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br/>

  Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br/>

  Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01117">But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br/>

  Came on so tardily, that we were new<br/>

  In company at each motion of the haunch.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01118">Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find<br/>

  Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br/>

  And thus in going move thine eye about."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01119">And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br/>

  Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,<br/>

  Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01120">Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."<br/>

  Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,<br/>

  And then according to his pace proceed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01121">I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br/>

  Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br/>

  But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01122">When they came up, long with an eye askance<br/>

  They scanned me without uttering a word.<br/>

  Then to each other turned, and said together:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01123">"He by the action of his throat seems living;<br/>

  And if they dead are, by what privilege<br/>

  Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01124">Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college<br/>

  Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br/>

  Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01125">And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up<br/>

  In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br/>

  And with the body am I've always had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01126">But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br/>

  Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br/>

  And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01127">And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks<br/>

  Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br/>

  Cause in this way their balances to creak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01128">Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br/>

  I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br/>

  Named, and together taken by thy city,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01129">As the wont is to take one man alone,<br/>

  For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br/>

  That still it is apparent round Gardingo."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01130">"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."<br/>

  But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br/>

  One crucified with three stakes on the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01131">When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br/>

  Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br/>

  And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01132">Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br/>

  Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br/>

  To put one man to torture for the people.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01133">Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br/>

  As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br/>

  Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01134">And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br/>

  Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br/>

  Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01135">And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br/>

  O'er him who was extended on the cross<br/>

  So vilely in eternal banishment.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01136">Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br/>

  "Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br/>

  If to the right hand any pass slope down<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01137">By which we two may issue forth from here,<br/>

  Without constraining some of the black angels<br/>

  To come and extricate us from this deep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01138">Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest<br/>

  There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br/>

  Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01139">Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br/>

  You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br/>

  That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01140">The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br/>

  Then said: "The business badly he recounted<br/>

  Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01141">And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices<br/>

  Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br/>

  That he's a liar and the father of lies."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01142">Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br/>

  Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br/>

  Whence from the heavy-laden I departed<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01143">After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>
<p id="id01144" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXIV</p>
<p id="id01145" style="margin-top: 2em">In that part of the youthful year wherein<br/>

  The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br/>

  And now the nights draw near to half the day,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01146">What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br/>

  The outward semblance of her sister white,<br/>

  But little lasts the temper of her pen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01147">The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br/>

  Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br/>

  All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01148">Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br/>

  Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br/>

  Then he returns and hope revives again,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01149">Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br/>

  In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,<br/>

  And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01150">Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br/>

  When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br/>

  And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01151">For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br/>

  The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br/>

  Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01152">His arms he opened, after some advisement<br/>

  Within himself elected, looking first<br/>

  Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01153">And even as he who acts and meditates,<br/>

  For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br/>

  So upward lifting me towards the summit<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01154">Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br/>

  Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,<br/>

  But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01155">This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br/>

  For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br/>

  Were able to ascend from jag to jag.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01156">And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br/>

  Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br/>

  He I know not, but I had been dead beat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01157">But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth<br/>

  Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br/>

  The structure of each valley doth import<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01158">That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br/>

  Still we arrived at length upon the point<br/>

  Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01159">The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br/>

  When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br/>

  Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01160">"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"<br/>

  My Master said; "for sitting upon down,<br/>

  Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01161">Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br/>

  Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br/>

  As smoke in air or in the water foam.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01162">And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish<br/>

  With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,<br/>

  If with its heavy body it sink not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01163">A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br/>

  'Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br/>

  Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01164">Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br/>

  Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br/>

  And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01165">Upward we took our way along the crag,<br/>

  Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br/>

  And more precipitous far than that before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01166">Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br/>

  Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br/>

  Not well adapted to articulate words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01167">I know not what it said, though o'er the back<br/>

  I now was of the arch that passes there;<br/>

  But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01168">I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br/>

  Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br/>

  Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01169">At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br/>

  For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br/>

  So I look down and nothing I distinguish."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01170">"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,<br/>

  Except the doing; for the modest asking<br/>

  Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01171">We from the bridge descended at its head,<br/>

  Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br/>

  And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01172">And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br/>

  Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br/>

  That the remembrance still congeals my blood<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01173">Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br/>

  For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br/>

  She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01174">Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br/>

  E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br/>

  Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01175">Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br/>

  People were running naked and affrighted.<br/>

  Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01176">They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br/>

  These riveted upon their reins the tail<br/>

  And head, and were in front of them entwined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01177">And lo! at one who was upon our side<br/>

  There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br/>

  There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01178">Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,<br/>

  As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br/>

  Behoved it that in falling he became.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01179">And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br/>

  The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br/>

  Into himself they instantly returned.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01180">Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed<br/>

  The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br/>

  When it approaches its five-hundredth year;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01181">On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br/>

  But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br/>

  And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01182">And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br/>

  By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br/>

  Or other oppilation that binds man,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01183">When he arises and around him looks,<br/>

  Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br/>

  Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01184">Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br/>

  Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br/>

  That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01185">The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br/>

  Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany<br/>

  A short time since into this cruel gorge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01186">A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br/>

  Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,<br/>

  Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01187">And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,<br/>

  And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br/>

  For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01188">And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br/>

  But unto me directed mind and face,<br/>

  And with a melancholy shame was painted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01189">Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br/>

  Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br/>

  Than when I from the other life was taken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01190">What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br/>

  So low am I put down because I robbed<br/>

  The sacristy of the fair ornaments,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01191">And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;<br/>

  But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,<br/>

  If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01192">Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:<br/>

  Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<br/>

  Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01193">Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,<br/>

  Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,<br/>

  And with impetuous and bitter tempest<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01194">Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;<br/>

  When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,<br/>

  So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01195">And this I've said that it may give thee pain."</p>
<p id="id01196" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXV</p>
<p id="id01197" style="margin-top: 2em">At the conclusion of his words, the thief<br/>

  Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<br/>

  Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01198">From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br/>

  For one entwined itself about his neck<br/>

  As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01199">And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br/>

  Clinching itself together so in front,<br/>

  That with them he could not a motion make.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01200">Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<br/>

  To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,<br/>

  Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01201">Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br/>

  Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br/>

  Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01202">He fled away, and spake no further word;<br/>

  And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br/>

  Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01203">I do not think Maremma has so many<br/>

  Serpents as he had all along his back,<br/>

  As far as where our countenance begins.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01204">Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br/>

  With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br/>

  And he sets fire to all that he encounters.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01205">My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who<br/>

  Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br/>

  Created oftentimes a lake of blood.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01206">He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br/>

  By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br/>

  Of the great herd, which he had near to him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01207">Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br/>

  The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br/>

  Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01208">While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br/>

  And spirits three had underneath us come,<br/>

  Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01209">Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"<br/>

  On which account our story made a halt,<br/>

  And then we were intent on them alone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01210">I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br/>

  As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br/>

  That one to name the other was compelled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01211">Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"<br/>

  Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br/>

  Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01212">If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br/>

  What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br/>

  For I who saw it hardly can admit it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01213">As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br/>

  Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br/>

  In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01214">With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br/>

  And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br/>

  Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01215">The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br/>

  And put its tail through in between the two,<br/>

  And up behind along the reins outspread it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01216">Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br/>

  Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br/>

  Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01217">Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br/>

  They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br/>

  Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01218">E'en as proceedeth on before the flame<br/>

  Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br/>

  Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01219">The other two looked on, and each of them<br/>

  Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br/>

  Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01220">Already the two heads had one become,<br/>

  When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br/>

  Into one face, wherein the two were lost.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01221">Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br/>

  The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br/>

  Members became that never yet were seen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01222">Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br/>

  Two and yet none did the perverted image<br/>

  Appear, and such departed with slow pace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01223">Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br/>

  Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br/>

  Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01224">Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br/>

  Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br/>

  Livid and black as is a peppercorn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01225">And in that part whereat is first received<br/>

  Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br/>

  Then downward fell in front of him extended.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01226">The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br/>

  Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br/>

  Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01227">He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br/>

  One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br/>

  Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01228">Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br/>

  Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br/>

  And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01229">Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br/>

  For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br/>

  Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01230">Because two natures never front to front<br/>

  Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br/>

  To interchange their matter ready were.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01231">Together they responded in such wise,<br/>

  That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br/>

  And eke the wounded drew his feet together.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01232">The legs together with the thighs themselves<br/>

  Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br/>

  No sign whatever made that was apparent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01233">He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br/>

  The other one was losing, and his skin<br/>

  Became elastic, and the other's hard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01234">I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br/>

  And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br/>

  Lengthen as much as those contracted were.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01235">Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br/>

  Became the member that a man conceals,<br/>

  And of his own the wretch had two created.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01236">While both of them the exhalation veils<br/>

  With a new colour, and engenders hair<br/>

  On one of them and depilates the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01237">The one uprose and down the other fell,<br/>

  Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br/>

  Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01238">He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,<br/>

  And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br/>

  Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01239">What did not backward run and was retained<br/>

  Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br/>

  And the lips thickened far as was befitting.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01240">He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br/>

  And backward draws the ears into his head,<br/>

  In the same manner as the snail its horns;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01241">And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br/>

  For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br/>

  In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01242">The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br/>

  Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br/>

  And after him the other speaking sputters.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01243">Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br/>

  And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,<br/>

  Crawling as I have done, along this road."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01244">In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br/>

  Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br/>

  The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01245">And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br/>

  Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br/>

  They could not flee away so secretly<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01246">But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br/>

  And he it was who sole of three companions,<br/>

  Which came in the beginning, was not changed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01247">The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>

<p id="id01255">Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,<br/>

  When I direct my mind to what I saw,<br/>

  And more my genius curb than I am wont,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01256">That it may run not unless virtue guide it;<br/>

  So that if some good star, or better thing,<br/>

  Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01257">As many as the hind (who on the hill<br/>

  Rests at the time when he who lights the world<br/>

  His countenance keeps least concealed from us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01258">While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)<br/>

  Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,<br/>

  Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01259">With flames as manifold resplendent all<br/>

  Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br/>

  As soon as I was where the depth appeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01260">And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br/>

  Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,<br/>

  What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01261">For with his eye he could not follow it<br/>

  So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br/>

  Even as a little cloud ascending upward,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01262">Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br/>

  Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br/>

  And every flame a sinner steals away.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01263">I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br/>

  So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br/>

  Down had I fallen without being pushed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01264">And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br/>

  Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;<br/>

  Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01265">"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee<br/>

  I am more sure; but I surmised already<br/>

  It might be so, and already wished to ask thee<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01266">Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br/>

  At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br/>

  Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01267">He answered me: "Within there are tormented<br/>

  Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br/>

  They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01268">And there within their flame do they lament<br/>

  The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br/>

  Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01269">Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br/>

  Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br/>

  And pain for the Palladium there is borne."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01270">"If they within those sparks possess the power<br/>

  To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,<br/>

  And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01271">That thou make no denial of awaiting<br/>

  Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br/>

  Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01272">And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty<br/>

  Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br/>

  But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01273">Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br/>

  That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br/>

  Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01274">When now the flame had come unto that point,<br/>

  Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br/>

  After this fashion did I hear him speak:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01275">"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br/>

  If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br/>

  If I deserved of you or much or little<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01276">When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br/>

  Do not move on, but one of you declare<br/>

  Whither, being lost, he went away to die."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01277">Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br/>

  Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br/>

  Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01278">Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br/>

  Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br/>

  It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01279">From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br/>

  More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br/>

  Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01280">Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br/>

  For my old father, nor the due affection<br/>

  Which joyous should have made Penelope,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01281">Could overcome within me the desire<br/>

  I had to be experienced of the world,<br/>

  And of the vice and virtue of mankind;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01282">But I put forth on the high open sea<br/>

  With one sole ship, and that small company<br/>

  By which I never had deserted been.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01283">Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br/>

  Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br/>

  And the others which that sea bathes round about.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01284">I and my company were old and slow<br/>

  When at that narrow passage we arrived<br/>

  Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01285">That man no farther onward should adventure.<br/>

  On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br/>

  And on the other already had left Ceuta.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01286">'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br/>

  Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,<br/>

  To this so inconsiderable vigil<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01287">Which is remaining of your senses still<br/>

  Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br/>

  Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01288">Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br/>

  Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br/>

  But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01289">So eager did I render my companions,<br/>

  With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br/>

  That then I hardly could have held them back.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01290">And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br/>

  We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br/>

  Evermore gaining on the larboard side.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01291">Already all the stars of the other pole<br/>

  The night beheld, and ours so very low<br/>

  It did not rise above the ocean floor.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01292">Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br/>

  Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br/>

  Since we had entered into the deep pass,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01293">When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br/>

  From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br/>

  As I had never any one beheld.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01294">Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br/>

  For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br/>

  And smote upon the fore part of the ship.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01295">Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br/>

  At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br/>

  And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01296">Until the sea above us closed again."</p>
<p id="id01297" style="margin-top: 3em">Inferno: Canto XXVII</p>
<p id="id01298" style="margin-top: 2em">Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br/>

  To speak no more, and now departed from us<br/>

  With the permission of the gentle Poet;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01299">When yet another, which behind it came,<br/>

  Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br/>

  By a confused sound that issued from it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01300">As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br/>

  With the lament of him, and that was right,<br/>

  Who with his file had modulated it)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01301">Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,<br/>

  That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,<br/>

  Still it appeared with agony transfixed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01302">Thus, by not having any way or issue<br/>

  At first from out the fire, to its own language<br/>

  Converted were the melancholy words.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01303">But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br/>

  Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br/>

  The tongue had given them in their passage out,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01304">We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim<br/>

  My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,<br/>

  Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01305">Because I come perchance a little late,<br/>

  To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br/>

  Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01306">If thou but lately into this blind world<br/>

  Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,<br/>

  Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01307">Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,<br/>

  For I was from the mountains there between<br/>

  Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01308">I still was downward bent and listening,<br/>

  When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br/>

  Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01309">And I, who had beforehand my reply<br/>

  In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br/>

  "O soul, that down below there art concealed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01310">Romagna thine is not and never has been<br/>

  Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;<br/>

  But open war I none have left there now.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01311">Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;<br/>

  The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br/>

  So that she covers Cervia with her vans.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01312">The city which once made the long resistance,<br/>

  And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br/>

  Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01313">Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,<br/>

  Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,<br/>

  Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01314">The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br/>

  Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br/>

  Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01315">And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br/>

  Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br/>

  Lives between tyranny and a free state.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01316">Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br/>

  Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br/>

  So may thy name hold front there in the world."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01317">After the fire a little more had roared<br/>

  In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br/>

  This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01318">"If I believed that my reply were made<br/>

  To one who to the world would e'er return,<br/>

  This flame without more flickering would stand still;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01319">But inasmuch as never from this depth<br/>

  Did any one return, if I hear true,<br/>

  Without the fear of infamy I answer,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01320">I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br/>

  Believing thus begirt to make amends;<br/>

  And truly my belief had been fulfilled<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01321">But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,<br/>

  Who put me back into my former sins;<br/>

  And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01322">While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br/>

  My mother gave to me, the deeds I did<br/>

  Were not those of a lion, but a fox.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01323">The machinations and the covert ways<br/>

  I knew them all, and practised so their craft,<br/>

  That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01324">When now unto that portion of mine age<br/>

  I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br/>

  To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01325">That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br/>

  And penitent and confessing I surrendered,<br/>

  Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01326">The Leader of the modern Pharisees<br/>

  Having a war near unto Lateran,<br/>

  And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01327">For each one of his enemies was Christian,<br/>

  And none of them had been to conquer Acre,<br/>

  Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01328">Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,<br/>

  In him regarded, nor in me that cord<br/>

  Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01329">But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<br/>

  To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,<br/>

  So this one sought me out as an adept<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01330">To cure him of the fever of his pride.<br/>

  Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,<br/>

  Because his words appeared inebriate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01331">And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;<br/>

  Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me<br/>

  How to raze Palestrina to the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01332">Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,<br/>

  As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,<br/>

  The which my predecessor held not dear.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01333">Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br/>

  There, where my silence was the worst advice;<br/>

  And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01334">Of that sin into which I now must fall,<br/>

  The promise long with the fulfilment short<br/>

  Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01335">Francis came afterward, when I was dead,<br/>

  For me; but one of the black Cherubim<br/>

  Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01336">He must come down among my servitors,<br/>

  Because he gave the fraudulent advice<br/>

  From which time forth I have been at his hair;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01337">For who repents not cannot be absolved,<br/>

  Nor can one both repent and will at once,<br/>

  Because of the contradiction which consents not.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01338">O miserable me! how I did shudder<br/>

  When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure<br/>

  Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01339">He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br/>

  Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br/>

  And after he had bitten it in great rage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01340">Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'<br/>

  Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,<br/>

  And vested thus in going I bemoan me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01341">When it had thus completed its recital,<br/>

  The flame departed uttering lamentations,<br/>

  Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01342">Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,<br/>

  Up o'er the crag above another arch,<br/>

  Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee<br/>

  By reason of our speech and memory,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01347">If were again assembled all the people<br/>

  Which formerly upon the fateful land<br/>

  Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01348">Shed by the Romans and the lingering war<br/>

  That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,<br/>

  With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01352">A cask by losing centre-piece or cant<br/>

  Was never shattered so, as I saw one<br/>

  Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01353">Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;<br/>

  His heart was visible, and the dismal sack<br/>

  That maketh excrement of what is eaten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01354">While I was all absorbed in seeing him,<br/>

  He looked at me, and opened with his hands<br/>

  His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;<br/>

<p id="id01355">How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;<br/>

<p id="id01357">A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us<br/>

  Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge<br/>

  Putting again each one of all this ream,<br/>

  By reason that our wounds are closed again<br/>

  Ere any one in front of him repass.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01359">But who art thou, that musest on the crag,<br/>

  Perchance to postpone going to the pain<br/>

  That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01360">"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"<br/>

  My Master made reply, "to be tormented;<br/>

<p id="id01361">Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him<br/>

  Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;<br/>

  And this is true as that I speak to thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01362">More than a hundred were there when they heard him,<br/>

  Who in the moat stood still to look at me,<br/>

  Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01363">"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,<br/>

  Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01365">After one foot to go away he lifted,<br/>

  This word did Mahomet say unto me,<br/>

  Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01366">Another one, who had his throat pierced through,<br/>

  Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.<br/>

<p id="id01378">O how bewildered unto me appeared,<br/>

  With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,<br/>

  Curio, who in speaking was so bold!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01379">And one, who both his hands dissevered had,<br/>

  The stumps uplifting through the murky air,<br/>

  So that the blood made horrible his face,<br/>

<p id="id01380">Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01381">"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;<br/>

  Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,<br/>

  Departed, like a person sad and crazed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01382">But I remained to look upon the crowd;<br/>

  And saw a thing which I should be afraid,<br/>

  Without some further proof, even to recount,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01383">If it were not that conscience reassures me,<br/>

  That good companion which emboldens man<br/>

  Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01384">I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,<br/>

  A trunk without a head walk in like manner<br/>

  As walked the others of the mournful herd.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01385">And by the hair it held the head dissevered,<br/>

  Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,<br/>

  And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01386">It of itself made to itself a lamp,<br/>

  And they were two in one, and one in two;<br/>

  How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01387">When it was come close to the bridge's foot,<br/>

  It lifted high its arm with all the head,<br/>

  To bring more closely unto us its words,<br/>

  These eyes of mine had so inebriated,<br/>

  That they were wishful to stand still and weep;<br/>

<p id="id01395">But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?<br/>

  Why is thy sight still riveted down there<br/>

  Among the mournful, mutilated shades?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01396">Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;<br/>

  Consider, if to count them thou believest,<br/>

<p id="id01397">And now the moon is underneath our feet;<br/>

<p id="id01398">"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,<br/>

  "Attended to the cause for which I looked,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01399">Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him<br/>

  I went, already making my reply,<br/>

  And superadding: "In that cavern where<br/>

<p id="id01400">I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br/>

  I think a spirit of my blood laments<br/>

  The sin which down below there costs so much."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01401">Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken<br/>

  Thy thought from this time forward upon him;<br/>

  Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01402">For him I saw below the little bridge,<br/>

  Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger<br/>

  Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01403">So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br/>

<p id="id01404">"O my Conductor, his own violent death,<br/>

<p id="id01405">Made him disdainful; whence he went away,<br/>

  As I imagine, without speaking to me,<br/>

  And thereby made me pity him the more."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01406">Thus did we speak as far as the first place<br/>

  Upon the crag, which the next valley shows<br/>

  Down to the bottom, if there were more light.<br/>

<p id="id01407">When we were now right over the last cloister<br/>

  Such was it here, and such a stench came from it<br/>

  As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01411">We had descended on the furthest bank<br/>

  From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br/>

<p id="id01412">Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress<br/>

  The spirits languishing in divers heaps.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01416">This on the belly, that upon the back<br/>

  One of the other lay, and others crawling<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01417">We step by step went onward without speech,<br/>

  Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br/>

  Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01418">I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br/>

  As leans in heating platter against platter,<br/>

  From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01419">And never saw I plied a currycomb<br/>

  By stable-boy for whom his master waits,<br/>

  Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01420">As every one was plying fast the bite<br/>

  Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br/>

  Of itching which no other succour had.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01421">And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br/>

  In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br/>

  Or any other fish that has them largest.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01422">"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"<br/>

  Began my Leader unto one of them,<br/>

  "And makest of them pincers now and then,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01423">Tell me if any Latian is with those<br/>

  To all eternity unto this work."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01424">"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br/>

  Both of us here," one weeping made reply;<br/>

  "But who art thou, that questionest about us?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01425">And said the Guide: "One am I who descends<br/>

  Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br/>

<p id="id01426">Then broken was their mutual support,<br/>

  And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br/>

  With others who had heard him by rebound.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01427">Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br/>

  Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."<br/>

  And I began, since he would have it so:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01428">"So may your memory not steal away<br/>

  In the first world from out the minds of men,<br/>

  But so may it survive 'neath many suns,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01429">Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br/>

  Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br/>

  Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01430">"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,<br/>

  That I could rise by flight into the air,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01432">Would have me show to him the art; and only<br/>

  Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<br/>

  Be burned by one who held him as his son.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01433">But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br/>

  For alchemy, which in the world I practised,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01434">And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever<br/>

  So vain a people as the Sienese?<br/>

  Not for a certainty the French by far."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01435">Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br/>

<p id="id01451">One to Capocchio came, and by the nape<br/>

  At being, peradventure, named so darkly,<br/>

  Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.<br/>

<p id="id01476">It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<br/>

  And Master Adam smote him in the face,<br/>

<p id="id01480">"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"<br/>

<p id="id01481">"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"<br/>

<p id="id01482">"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks<br/>

  Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01483">Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide<br/>

<p id="id01485">In listening to them was I wholly fixed,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01486">When him I heard in anger speak to me,<br/>

  I turned me round towards him with such shame<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01488">Such I became, not having power to speak,<br/>

  Excused myself, and did not think I did it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01489">"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"<br/>

  The Master said, "than this of thine has been;<br/>

<p id="id01490">And make account that I am aye beside thee,<br/>

  If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee<br/>

  Upon the bank that girds it round about,<br/>

  Going across it without any speech.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01496">There it was less than night, and less than day,<br/>

  So that my sight went little in advance;<br/>

  But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01497">So loud it would have made each thunder faint,<br/>

  Which, counter to it following its way,<br/>

  Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01498">After the dolorous discomfiture<br/>

  When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,<br/>

  So terribly Orlando sounded not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01499">Short while my head turned thitherward I held<br/>

  When many lofty towers I seemed to see,<br/>

  Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01500">And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth<br/>

  Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,<br/>

  It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01501">Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,<br/>

  How much the sense deceives itself by distance;<br/>

  Therefore a little faster spur thee on."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01502">Then tenderly he took me by the hand,<br/>

  And said: "Before we farther have advanced,<br/>

  That the reality may seem to thee<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01503">Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,<br/>

  And they are in the well, around the bank,<br/>

  From navel downward, one and all of them."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01504">As, when the fog is vanishing away,<br/>

  Little by little doth the sight refigure<br/>

  Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01505">So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,<br/>

  More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,<br/>

  My error fled, and fear came over me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01506">Because as on its circular parapets<br/>

  Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<br/>

  E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01507">With one half of their bodies turreted<br/>

  The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces<br/>

  E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01508">And I of one already saw the face,<br/>

  Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,<br/>

  And down along his sides both of the arms.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01509">Certainly Nature, when she left the making<br/>

  Of animals like these, did well indeed,<br/>

  By taking such executors from Mars;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01510">And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br/>

  Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br/>

  More just and more discreet will hold her for it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01511">For where the argument of intellect<br/>

  Is added unto evil will and power,<br/>

  No rampart can the people make against it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01512">His face appeared to me as long and large<br/>

  As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,<br/>

  And in proportion were the other bones;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01513">So that the margin, which an apron was<br/>

  Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br/>

  Above it, that to reach up to his hair<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01514">Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br/>

  For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br/>

  Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.<br/>

<p id="id01516">And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,<br/>

  Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01517">Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br/>

  Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br/>

  And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01518">Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;<br/>

  This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br/>

  One language in the world is not still used.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01519">Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br/>

  For even such to him is every language<br/>

  As his to others, which to none is known."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01520">Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br/>

  Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br/>

  We found another far more fierce and large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01521">In binding him, who might the master be<br/>

  I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br/>

  Behind the right arm, and in front the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01522">With chains, that held him so begirt about<br/>

  From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br/>

  It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01523">"This proud one wished to make experiment<br/>

  Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"<br/>

  My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01524">Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br/>

  What time the giants terrified the gods;<br/>

  The arms he wielded never more he moves."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01525">And I to him: "If possible, I should wish<br/>

  That of the measureless Briareus<br/>

  These eyes of mine might have experience."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01526">Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br/>

  Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br/>

  Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01527">Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br/>

  And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br/>

  Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01528">There never was an earthquake of such might<br/>

  That it could shake a tower so violently,<br/>

  As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01529">Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br/>

  For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br/>

  If I had not beheld the manacles.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01530">Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br/>

  And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br/>

  Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01531">"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br/>

  Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br/>

  When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01532">Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br/>

  And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br/>

  Among thy brothers, some it seems still think<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01533">The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br/>

  Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br/>

  There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01534">Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br/>

  This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br/>

  Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01535">Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br/>

  Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br/>

  If to itself Grace call him not untimely."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01536">So said the Master; and in haste the other<br/>

  His hands extended and took up my Guide,—<br/>

  Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01537">Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br/>

  Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"<br/>

  Then of himself and me one bundle made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01538">As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br/>

  Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br/>

  Above it so that opposite it hangs;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01539">Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br/>

  Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br/>

  I could have wished to go some other way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01540">But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br/>

  Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br/>

  Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01541">But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>

<p id="id01543" style="margin-top: 2em">If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01544">I would press out the juice of my conception<br/>

  More fully; but because I have them not,<br/>

  Not without fear I bring myself to speak;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01545">For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01549">I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!<br/>

  Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br/>

  The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01550">Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br/>

  And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br/>

  The semblance had of glass, and not of water.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01551">So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current<br/>

  In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br/>

  Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01552">As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br/>

  Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br/>

<p id="id01553">And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br/>

  With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01554">Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br/>

  Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br/>

  Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01555">Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br/>

  From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br/>

  Among them witness of itself procures.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01556">When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br/>

  I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br/>

  The hair upon their heads together mingled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01557">"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"<br/>

  I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,<br/>

  And when to me their faces they had lifted,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01558">Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br/>

  Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br/>

  The tears between, and locked them up again.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01559">Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br/>

  So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br/>

  Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01560">And one, who had by reason of the cold<br/>

  Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br/>

  Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01561">If thou desire to know who these two are,<br/>

  The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br/>

  Belonged to them and to their father Albert.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01562">They from one body came, and all Caina<br/>

  Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br/>

  More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01563">Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br/>

  At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;<br/>

  Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01564">So with his head I see no farther forward,<br/>

  And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br/>

  Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01565">And that thou put me not to further speech,<br/>

  Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,<br/>

  And wait Carlino to exonerate me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01566">Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br/>

  Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,<br/>

  And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01567">And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,<br/>

  Where everything of weight unites together,<br/>

  And I was shivering in the eternal shade,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01568">Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br/>

  I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads<br/>

  I struck my foot hard in the face of one.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01569">Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?<br/>

  Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br/>

  of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01570">And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,<br/>

  That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br/>

  Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01571">The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br/>

  Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br/>

  "Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01572">"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br/>

  Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,<br/>

  So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01573">"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"<br/>

  Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,<br/>

  That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01574">And he to me: "For the reverse I long;<br/>

  Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br/>

  For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01575">Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br/>

  And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,<br/>

  Or not a hair remain upon thee here."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01576">Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,<br/>

  I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br/>

  If on my head a thousand times thou fall."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01577">I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br/>

  And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br/>

  He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01578">When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br/>

  Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br/>

  But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01579">"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,<br/>

  Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br/>

  I will report of thee veracious news."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01580">"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,<br/>

  But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br/>

  Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01581">He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br/>

  'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera<br/>

  There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01582">If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br/>

  Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,<br/>

  Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01583">Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be<br/>

  Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello<br/>

  Who oped Faenza when the people slep."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01584">Already we had gone away from him,<br/>

  When I beheld two frozen in one hole,<br/>

  So that one head a hood was to the other;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01585">And even as bread through hunger is devoured,<br/>

  The uppermost on the other set his teeth,<br/>

  There where the brain is to the nape united.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01586">Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed<br/>

  The temples of Menalippus in disdain,<br/>

  Than that one did the skull and the other things.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01587">"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br/>

  Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br/>

  Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01588">That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br/>

  In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,<br/>

  I in the world above repay thee for it,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01592">Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew<br/>

  The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br/>

  To think of only, ere I speak of it;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01593">But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br/>

  Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br/>

  Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01594">I know not who thou art, nor by what mode<br/>

  Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine<br/>

  Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01595">Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<br/>

  And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;<br/>

  Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01596">That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01597"> But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,<br/>

  That is to say, how cruel was my death,<br/>

  Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01598">A narrow perforation in the mew,<br/>

  Which bears because of me the title of Famine,<br/>

  And in which others still must be locked up,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01599">Had shown me through its opening many moons<br/>

  Already, when I dreamed the evil dream<br/>

  Which of the future rent for me the veil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01600">This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br/>

  Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain<br/>

  For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01601">With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br/>

  Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br/>

  He had sent out before him to the front.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01602">After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br/>

  The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br/>

  It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01603">When I before the morrow was awake,<br/>

  Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br/>

  Who with me were, and asking after bread.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01604">Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br/>

  Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br/>

  And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01605">They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br/>

  At which our food used to be brought to us,<br/>

  And through his dream was each one apprehensive;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01606">And I heard locking up the under door<br/>

  Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br/>

  I gazed into the faces of my sons.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01607">I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br/>

  They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br/>

  Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01608">Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br/>

  All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,<br/>

  Until another sun rose on the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01609">As now a little glimmer made its way<br/>

  Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br/>

  Upon four faces my own very aspect,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01610">Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br/>

  And, thinking that I did it from desire<br/>

  Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01611">And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us<br/>

  If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br/>

  With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01612">I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br/>

  That day we all were silent, and the next.<br/>

  Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01613">When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br/>

  Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,<br/>

  Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01614">And there he died; and, as thou seest me,<br/>

  I saw the three fall, one by one, between<br/>

  The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01615">Already blind, to groping over each,<br/>

  And three days called them after they were dead;<br/>

  Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01616">When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br/>

  The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br/>

  Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01617">Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br/>

  Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,<br/>

  Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01618">Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br/>

  And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br/>

  That every person in thee it may drown!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01619">For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br/>

  Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br/>

  Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01620">Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br/>

  Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br/>

  And the other two my song doth name above!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01621">We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br/>

  Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br/>

  Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01622">Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br/>

  And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br/>

  Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01623">Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br/>

  And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br/>

  Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01624">And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br/>

  Because of cold all sensibility<br/>

  Its station had abandoned in my face,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01625">Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br/>

  Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?<br/>

  Is not below here every vapour quenched?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01626">Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where<br/>

  Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br/>

  Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01627">And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br/>

  Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless<br/>

  That the last post is given unto you,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01628">Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br/>

  May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br/>

  A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01629">Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee<br/>

  Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br/>

  May I go to the bottom of the ice."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01630">Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;<br/>

  He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br/>

  Who here a date am getting for my fig."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01631">"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"<br/>

  And he to me: "How may my body fare<br/>

  Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01632">Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br/>

  That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br/>

  Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01633">And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br/>

  From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br/>

  Know that as soon as any soul betrays<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01634">As I have done, his body by a demon<br/>

  Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br/>

  Until his time has wholly been revolved.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01635">Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br/>

  And still perchance above appears the body<br/>

  Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01636">This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br/>

  It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years<br/>

  Have passed away since he was thus locked up."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01637">"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;<br/>

  For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,<br/>

  And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01638">"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,<br/>

  There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br/>

  As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01639">When this one left a devil in his stead<br/>

  In his own body and one near of kin,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01640">But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br/>

  Open mine eyes;"—and open them I did not,<br/>

  And to be rude to him was courtesy.<br/>

<p id="id01641">Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br/>

  Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br/>

  Because all language would be insufficient.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01653">I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br/>

  Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br/>

  What I became, being of both deprived.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01654">The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br/>

  From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br/>

  And better with a giant I compare<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01655">Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br/>

  Consider now how great must be that whole,<br/>

  Which unto such a part conforms itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01656">Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br/>

  And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br/>

  Well may proceed from him all tribulation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01657">O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br/>

  When I beheld three faces on his head!<br/>

  The one in front, and that vermilion was;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01658">Two were the others, that were joined with this<br/>

  Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br/>

  And they were joined together at the crest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01659">And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;<br/>

  The left was such to look upon as those<br/>

  Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01660">Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br/>

  Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br/>

  Sails of the sea I never saw so large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01661"> No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br/>

  Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br/>

  So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01662">Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br/>

  With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br/>

  Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01663">At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br/>

  A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br/>

  So that he three of them tormented thus.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01664">To him in front the biting was as naught<br/>

  Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br/>

  Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01665">"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"<br/>

  The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;<br/>

  With head inside, he plies his legs without.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01666">Of the two others, who head downward are,<br/>

  The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br/>

  See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01667">And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br/>

  But night is reascending, and 'tis time<br/>

  That we depart, for we have seen the whole."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01668">As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br/>

  And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br/>

  And when the wings were opened wide apart,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01669">He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br/>

  From fell to fell descended downward then<br/>

  Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01670">When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br/>

  Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br/>

  The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01671">Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br/>

  And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br/>

  So that to Hell I thought we were returning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01672">"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"<br/>

  The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br/>

  "Must we perforce depart from so much evil."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01673">Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br/>

  And down upon the margin seated me;<br/>

  Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01674">I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br/>

  Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br/>

  And I beheld him upward hold his legs.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01675">And if I then became disquieted,<br/>

  Let stolid people think who do not see<br/>

  What the point is beyond which I had passed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01676">"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;<br/>

  The way is long, and difficult the road,<br/>

  And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01677">It was not any palace corridor<br/>

  There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br/>

  With floor uneven and unease of light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01678">"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br/>

  My Master," said I when I had arisen,<br/>

  "To draw me from an error speak a little;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01679">Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br/>

  Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br/>

  From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01680">And he to me: "Thou still imaginest<br/>

  Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br/>

  The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01681">That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br/>

  When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br/>

  To which things heavy draw from every side,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01682">And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br/>

  Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br/>

  Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01683">The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br/>

  Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br/>

  Which makes the other face of the Judecca.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01684">Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br/>

  And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br/>

  Still fixed remaineth as he was before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01685">Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br/>

  And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br/>

  For fear of him made of the sea a veil,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01686">And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br/>

  To flee from him, what on this side appears<br/>

  Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01687">A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br/>

  As far receding as the tomb extends,<br/>

  Which not by sight is known, but by the sound<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01688">Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br/>

  Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br/>

  With course that winds about and slightly falls.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01689">The Guide and I into that hidden road<br/>

  Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br/>

  And without care of having any rest<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01690">We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br/>

  Till I beheld through a round aperture<br/>

  Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01691">Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</p>
