			<p id="id03337" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto I</p>
			<p id="id03338" style="margin-top: 2em">The glory of Him who moveth everything<br/> Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<br/> In one part more and in another less.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03339">Within that heaven which most his light receives<br/> Was I, and things beheld which to repeat<br/> Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03340">Because in drawing near to its desire<br/> Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,<br/> That after it the memory cannot go.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03341">Truly whatever of the holy realm<br/> I had the power to treasure in my mind<br/> Shall now become the subject of my song.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03342">O good Apollo, for this last emprise<br/> Make of me such a vessel of thy power<br/> As giving the beloved laurel asks!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03343">One summit of Parnassus hitherto<br/> Has been enough for me, but now with both<br/> I needs must enter the arena left.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03344">Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<br/> As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<br/> Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03345">O power divine, lend’st thou thyself to me<br/> So that the shadow of the blessed realm<br/> Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03346">Thou’lt see me come unto thy darling tree,<br/> And crown myself thereafter with those leaves<br/> Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03347">So seldom, Father, do we gather them<br/> For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,<br/> (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03348">That the Peneian foliage should bring forth<br/> Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,<br/> When any one it makes to thirst for it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03349">A little spark is followed by great flame;<br/> Perchance with better voices after me<br/> Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03350">To mortal men by passages diverse<br/> Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one<br/> Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03351">With better course and with a better star<br/> Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<br/> Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03352">Almost that passage had made morning there<br/> And evening here, and there was wholly white<br/> That hemisphere, and black the other part,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03353">When Beatrice towards the left-hand side<br/> I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;<br/> Never did eagle fasten so upon it!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03354">And even as a second ray is wont<br/> To issue from the first and reascend,<br/> Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03355">Thus of her action, through the eyes infused<br/> In my imagination, mine I made,<br/> And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03356">There much is lawful which is here unlawful<br/> Unto our powers, by virtue of the place<br/> Made for the human species as its own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03357">Not long I bore it, nor so little while<br/> But I beheld it sparkle round about<br/> Like iron that comes molten from the fire;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03358">And suddenly it seemed that day to day<br/> Was added, as if He who has the power<br/> Had with another sun the heaven adorned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03359">With eyes upon the everlasting wheels<br/> Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her<br/> Fixing my vision from above removed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03360">Such at her aspect inwardly became<br/> As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<br/> Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03361">To represent transhumanise in words<br/> Impossible were; the example, then, suffice<br/> Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03362">If I was merely what of me thou newly<br/> Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,<br/> Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03363">When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<br/> Desiring thee, made me attentive to it<br/> By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03364">Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled<br/> By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river<br/> E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03365">The newness of the sound and the great light<br/> Kindled in me a longing for their cause,<br/> Never before with such acuteness felt;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03366">Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,<br/> To quiet in me my perturbed mind,<br/> Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03367">And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull<br/> With false imagining, that thou seest not<br/> What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03368">Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;<br/> But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<br/> Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03369">If of my former doubt I was divested<br/> By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,<br/> I in a new one was the more ensnared;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03370">And said: “Already did I rest content<br/> From great amazement; but am now amazed<br/> In what way I transcend these bodies light.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03371">Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,<br/> Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look<br/> A mother casts on a delirious child;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03372">And she began: “All things whate’er they be<br/> Have order among themselves, and this is form,<br/> That makes the universe resemble God.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03373">Here do the higher creatures see the footprints<br/> Of the Eternal Power, which is the end<br/> Whereto is made the law already mentioned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03374">In the order that I speak of are inclined<br/> All natures, by their destinies diverse,<br/> More or less near unto their origin;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03375">Hence they move onward unto ports diverse<br/> O’er the great sea of being; and each one<br/> With instinct given it which bears it on.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03376">This bears away the fire towards the moon;<br/> This is in mortal hearts the motive power<br/> This binds together and unites the earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03377">Nor only the created things that are<br/> Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,<br/> But those that have both intellect and love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03378">The Providence that regulates all this<br/> Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<br/> Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03379">And thither now, as to a site decreed,<br/> Bears us away the virtue of that cord<br/> Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03380">True is it, that as oftentimes the form<br/> Accords not with the intention of the art,<br/> Because in answering is matter deaf,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03381">So likewise from this course doth deviate<br/> Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,<br/> Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03382">(In the same wise as one may see the fire<br/> Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus<br/> Earthward is wrested by some false delight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03383">Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,<br/> At thine ascent, than at a rivulet<br/> From some high mount descending to the lowland.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03384">Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived<br/> Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,<br/> As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03385">Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</p>
			<p id="id03386" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span></p>
			<p id="id03387" style="margin-top: 2em">O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<br/> Eager to listen, have been following<br/> Behind my ship, that singing sails along,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03388">Turn back to look again upon your shores;<br/> Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,<br/> In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03389">The sea I sail has never yet been passed;<br/> Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<br/> And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03390">Ye other few who have the neck uplifted<br/> Betimes to th’ bread of Angels upon which<br/> One liveth here and grows not sated by it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03391">Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea<br/> Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you<br/> Upon the water that grows smooth again.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03392">Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<br/> Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,<br/> When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03393">The con-created and perpetual thirst<br/> For the realm deiform did bear us on,<br/> As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03394">Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;<br/> And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<br/> And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03395">Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing<br/> Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she<br/> From whom no care of mine could be concealed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03396">Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,<br/> Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind<br/> On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03397">It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,<br/> Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright<br/> As adamant on which the sun is striking.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03398">Into itself did the eternal pearl<br/> Receive us, even as water doth receive<br/> A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03399">If I was body, (and we here conceive not<br/> How one dimension tolerates another,<br/> Which needs must be if body enter body,)<br/></p>
			<p id="id03400">More the desire should be enkindled in us<br/> That essence to behold, wherein is seen<br/> How God and our own nature were united.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03401">There will be seen what we receive by faith,<br/> Not demonstrated, but self-evident<br/> In guise of the first truth that man believes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03402">I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly<br/> As most I can do I give thanks to Him<br/> Who has removed me from the mortal world.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03403">But tell me what the dusky spots may be<br/> Upon this body, which below on earth<br/> Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03404">Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion<br/> Of mortals be erroneous,” she said,<br/> “Where’er the key of sense doth not unlock,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03405">Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee<br/> Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,<br/> Thou seest that the reason has short wings.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03406">But tell me what thou think’st of it thyself.”<br/> And I: “What seems to us up here diverse,<br/> Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03407">And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed<br/> In error thy belief, if well thou hearest<br/> The argument that I shall make against it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03408">Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<br/> Which in their quality and quantity<br/> May noted be of aspects different.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03409">If this were caused by rare and dense alone,<br/> One only virtue would there be in all<br/> Or more or less diffused, or equally.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03410">Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits<br/> Of formal principles; and these, save one,<br/> Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03411">Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<br/> The cause thou askest, either through and through<br/> This planet thus attenuate were of matter,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03412">Or else, as in a body is apportioned<br/> The fat and lean, so in like manner this<br/> Would in its volume interchange the leaves.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03413">Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse<br/> It would be manifest by the shining through<br/> Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03414">This is not so; hence we must scan the other,<br/> And if it chance the other I demolish,<br/> Then falsified will thy opinion be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03415">But if this rarity go not through and through,<br/> There needs must be a limit, beyond which<br/> Its contrary prevents the further passing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03416">And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,<br/> Even as a colour cometh back from glass,<br/> The which behind itself concealeth lead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03417">Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself<br/> More dimly there than in the other parts,<br/> By being there reflected farther back.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03418">From this reply experiment will free thee<br/> If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be<br/> The fountain to the rivers of your arts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03419">Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br/> Alike from thee, the other more remote<br/> Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03420">Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back<br/> Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors<br/> And coming back to thee by all reflected.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03421">Though in its quantity be not so ample<br/> The image most remote, there shalt thou see<br/> How it perforce is equally resplendent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03422">Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays<br/> Naked the subject of the snow remains<br/> Both of its former colour and its cold,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03423">Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,<br/> Will I inform with such a living light,<br/> That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03424">Within the heaven of the divine repose<br/> Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies<br/> The being of whatever it contains.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03425">The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<br/> Divides this being by essences diverse,<br/> Distinguished from it, and by it contained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03426">The other spheres, by various differences,<br/> All the distinctions which they have within them<br/> Dispose unto their ends and their effects.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03427">Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br/> As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;<br/> Since from above they take, and act beneath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03428">Observe me well, how through this place I come<br/> Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter<br/> Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford<br/></p>
			<p id="id03429">The power and motion of the holy spheres,<br/> As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,<br/> Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03430">The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,<br/> From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<br/> The image takes, and makes of it a seal.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03431">And even as the soul within your dust<br/> Through members different and accommodated<br/> To faculties diverse expands itself,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03432">So likewise this Intelligence diffuses<br/> Its virtue multiplied among the stars.<br/> Itself revolving on its unity.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03433">Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage<br/> Make with the precious body that it quickens,<br/> In which, as life in you, it is combined.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03434">From the glad nature whence it is derived,<br/> The mingled virtue through the body shines,<br/> Even as gladness through the living pupil.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03435">From this proceeds whate’er from light to light<br/> Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:<br/> This is the formal principle that produces,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03436">According to its goodness, dark and bright.”</p>
			<p id="id03437" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></p>
			<p id="id03438" style="margin-top: 2em">That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<br/> Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,<br/> By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03439">And, that I might confess myself convinced<br/> And confident, so far as was befitting,<br/> I lifted more erect my head to speak.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03440">But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me<br/> So close to it, in order to be seen,<br/> That my confession I remembered not.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03441">Such as through polished and transparent glass,<br/> Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,<br/> But not so deep as that their bed be lost,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03442">Come back again the outlines of our faces<br/> So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white<br/> Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03443">Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,<br/> So that I ran in error opposite<br/> To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03444">As soon as I became aware of them,<br/> Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,<br/> To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03445">And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward<br/> Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,<br/> Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03446">“Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because<br/> I smile at this thy puerile conceit,<br/> Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03447">But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness.<br/> True substances are these which thou beholdest,<br/> Here relegate for breaking of some vow.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03448">Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;<br/> For the true light, which giveth peace to them,<br/> Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03449">And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful<br/> To speak directed me, and I began,<br/> As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03450">“O well-created spirit, who in the rays<br/> Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste<br/> Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03451">Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me<br/> Both with thy name and with your destiny.”<br/> Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03452">“Our charity doth never shut the doors<br/> Against a just desire, except as one<br/> Who wills that all her court be like herself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03453">I was a virgin sister in the world;<br/> And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,<br/> The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03454">But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,<br/> Who, stationed here among these other blessed,<br/> Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03455">All our affections, that alone inflamed<br/> Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,<br/> Rejoice at being of his order formed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03456">And this allotment, which appears so low,<br/> Therefore is given us, because our vows<br/> Have been neglected and in some part void.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03457">Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects<br/> There shines I know not what of the divine,<br/> Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03458">Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;<br/> But what thou tellest me now aids me so,<br/> That the refiguring is easier to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03459">But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,<br/> Are you desirous of a higher place,<br/> To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03460">First with those other shades she smiled a little;<br/> Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,<br/> She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03461">“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<br/> Of charity, that makes us wish alone<br/> For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03462">If to be more exalted we aspired,<br/> Discordant would our aspirations be<br/> Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03463">Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,<br/> If being in charity is needful here,<br/> And if thou lookest well into its nature;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03464">Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence<br/> To keep itself within the will divine,<br/> Whereby our very wishes are made one;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03465">So that, as we are station above station<br/> Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,<br/> As to the King, who makes his will our will.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03466">And his will is our peace; this is the sea<br/> To which is moving onward whatsoever<br/> It doth create, and all that nature makes.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03467">Then it was clear to me how everywhere<br/> In heaven is Paradise, although the grace<br/> Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03468">But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,<br/> And for another still remains the longing,<br/> We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03469">E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,<br/> To learn from her what was the web wherein<br/> She did not ply the shuttle to the end.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03470">“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven<br/> A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule<br/> Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03471">That until death they may both watch and sleep<br/> Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts<br/> Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03472">To follow her, in girlhood from the world<br/> I fled, and in her habit shut myself,<br/> And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03473">Then men accustomed unto evil more<br/> Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;<br/> God knows what afterward my life became.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03474">This other splendour, which to thee reveals<br/> Itself on my right side, and is enkindled<br/> With all the illumination of our sphere,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03475">What of myself I say applies to her;<br/> A nun was she, and likewise from her head<br/> Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03476">But when she too was to the world returned<br/> Against her wishes and against good usage,<br/> Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03477">Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<br/> Who from the second wind of Suabia<br/> Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03478">Thus unto me she spake, and then began<br/> “Ave Maria” singing, and in singing<br/> Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03479">My sight, that followed her as long a time<br/> As it was possible, when it had lost her<br/> Turned round unto the mark of more desire,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03480">And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;<br/> But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,<br/> That at the first my sight endured it not;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03481">And this in questioning more backward made me.</p>
			<p id="id03482" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span></p>
			<p id="id03483" style="margin-top: 2em">Between two viands, equally removed<br/> And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<br/> Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03484">So would a lamb between the ravenings<br/> Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;<br/> And so would stand a dog between two does.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03485">Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,<br/> Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,<br/> Since it must be so, nor do I commend.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03486">I held my peace; but my desire was painted<br/> Upon my face, and questioning with that<br/> More fervent far than by articulate speech.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03487">Beatrice did as Daniel had done<br/> Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath<br/> Which rendered him unjustly merciless,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03488">And said: “Well see I how attracteth thee<br/> One and the other wish, so that thy care<br/> Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03489">Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,<br/> The violence of others, for what reason<br/> Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?<br/></p>
			<p id="id03490">Again for doubting furnish thee occasion<br/> Souls seeming to return unto the stars,<br/> According to the sentiment of Plato.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03491">These are the questions which upon thy wish<br/> Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<br/> Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.<br/></p>

			<p id="id03497">On this account the Scripture condescends<br/> Unto your faculties, and feet and hands<br/> To God attributes, and means something else;<br/></p>

			<p id="id03500">He says the soul unto its star returns,<br/> Believing it to have been severed thence<br/> Whenever nature gave it as a form.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03501">Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise<br/> Than the words sound, and possibly may be<br/> With meaning that is not to be derided.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03502">If he doth mean that to these wheels return<br/> The honour of their influence and the blame,<br/> Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03503">This principle ill understood once warped<br/> The whole world nearly, till it went astray<br/> Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03504">The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<br/> Less venom has, for its malevolence<br/> Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03505">That as unjust our justice should appear<br/> In eyes of mortals, is an argument<br/> Of faith, and not of sin heretical.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03506">But still, that your perception may be able<br/> To thoroughly penetrate this verity,<br/> As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03507">If it be violence when he who suffers<br/> Co-operates not with him who uses force,<br/> These souls were not on that account excused;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03508">For will is never quenched unless it will,<br/> But operates as nature doth in fire<br/> If violence a thousand times distort it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03509">Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds<br/> The force; and these have done so, having power<br/> Of turning back unto the holy place.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03510">If their will had been perfect, like to that<br/> Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<br/> And Mutius made severe to his own hand,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03511">It would have urged them back along the road<br/> Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;<br/> But such a solid will is all too rare.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03512">And by these words, if thou hast gathered them<br/> As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted<br/> That would have still annoyed thee many times.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03513">But now another passage runs across<br/> Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself<br/> Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03514">I have for certain put into thy mind<br/> That soul beatified could never lie,<br/> For it is near the primal Truth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03515">And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard<br/> Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br/> So that she seemeth here to contradict me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03516">Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br/> That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br/> That has been done it was not right to do,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03517">E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br/> Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br/> Not to lose pity pitiless became.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03518">At this point I desire thee to remember<br/> That force with will commingles, and they cause<br/> That the offences cannot be excused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03519">Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br/> But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br/> If it refrain, to fall into more harm.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03520">Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br/> She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br/> The other, so that both of us speak truth.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03521">Such was the flowing of the holy river<br/> That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br/> This put to rest my wishes one and all.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03522">“O love of the first lover, O divine,”<br/> Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me<br/> And warms me so, it more and more revives me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03523">My own affection is not so profound<br/> As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br/> Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03524">Well I perceive that never sated is<br/> Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br/> Beyond which nothing true expands itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03525">It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br/> When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br/> If not, then each desire would frustrate be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03526">Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br/> Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br/> Which to the top from height to height impels us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03527">This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br/> With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br/> Another truth, which is obscure to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03528">I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br/> For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br/> That in your balance they will not be light.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03529">Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br/> Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br/> That, overcome my power, I turned my back<br/></p>
			<p id="id03530">And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p>
			<p id="id03531" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span></p>
			<p id="id03532" style="margin-top: 2em">“If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br/> Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br/> So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03533">Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br/> From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br/> To the good apprehended moves its feet.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03534">Well I perceive how is already shining<br/> Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br/> That only seen enkindles always love;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03535">And if some other thing your love seduce,<br/> ’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br/> Ill understood, which there is shining through.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03536">Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br/> For broken vow can such return be made<br/> As to secure the soul from further claim.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03537">This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br/> And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br/> Continued thus her holy argument:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03538">“The greatest gift that in his largess God<br/> Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br/> Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize<br/></p>
			<p id="id03539">Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br/> Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br/> Both all and only were and are endowed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03540">Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br/> The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br/> So that when thou consentest God consents:<br/></p>
			<p id="id03541">For, closing between God and man the compact,<br/> A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br/> Such as I say, and made by its own act.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03542">What can be rendered then as compensation?<br/> Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,<br/> With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03543">Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br/> But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br/> Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03544">Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br/> Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br/> Requireth further aid for thy digestion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03545">Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br/> And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,<br/> The having heard without retaining it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03546">In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br/> Convene together; and the one is that<br/> Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03547">This last for evermore is cancelled not<br/> Unless complied with, and concerning this<br/> With such precision has above been spoken.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03548">Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br/> To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br/> Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03549">The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br/> May well indeed be such that one errs not<br/> If it for other matter be exchanged.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03550">But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br/> At his arbitrament, without the turning<br/> Both of the white and of the yellow key;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03551">And every permutation deem as foolish,<br/> If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br/> As the four is in six, be not contained.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03552">Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br/> In value that it drags down every balance,<br/> Cannot be satisfied with other spending.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03553">Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br/> Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br/> As Jephthah was in his first offering,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03554">Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,<br/> Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br/> Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03555">Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br/> And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br/> Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’<br/></p>
			<p id="id03556">Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br/> Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br/> And think not every water washes you.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03557">Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br/> And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br/> Let this suffice you unto your salvation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03558">If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br/> Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br/> So that the Jew among you may not mock you.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03559">Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br/> Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple<br/> Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03560">Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br/> Then all desireful turned herself again<br/> To that part where the world is most alive.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03561">Her silence and her change of countenance<br/> Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br/> That had already in advance new questions;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03562">And as an arrow that upon the mark<br/> Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br/> So did we speed into the second realm.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03563">My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br/> As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br/> More luminous thereat the planet grew;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03564">And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br/> What became I, who by my nature am<br/> Exceeding mutable in every guise!<br/></p>
			<p id="id03565">As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br/> The fishes draw to that which from without<br/> Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03566">So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br/> Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br/> “Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03567">And as each one was coming unto us,<br/> Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br/> By the effulgence clear that issued from it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03568">Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br/> No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br/> An agonizing need of knowing more;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03569">And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these<br/> Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br/> As they unto mine eyes were manifest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03570">“O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br/> To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br/> Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned<br/></p>
			<p id="id03571">With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br/> Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br/> To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03572">Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br/> Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak<br/> Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03573">“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br/> In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br/> Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03574">But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br/> Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br/> That veils itself to men in alien rays.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id03575">This said I in direction of the light<br/> Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br/> By far more lucent than it was before.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03576">Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br/> By too much light, when heat has worn away<br/> The tempering influence of the vapours dense,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03577">By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br/> In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br/> And thus close, close enfolded answered me<br/></p>
			<p id="id03578">In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p>
			<p id="id03579" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span></p>

			<p id="id03581">Two hundred years and more the bird of God<br/> In the extreme of Europe held itself,<br/> Near to the mountains whence it issued first;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03582">And under shadow of the sacred plumes<br/> It governed there the world from hand to hand,<br/> And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03583">Caesar I was, and am Justinian,<br/> Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,<br/> Took from the laws the useless and redundant;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03584">And ere unto the work I was attent,<br/> One nature to exist in Christ, not more,<br/> Believed, and with such faith was I contented.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03585">But blessed Agapetus, he who was<br/> The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere<br/> Pointed me out the way by words of his.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03586">Him I believed, and what was his assertion<br/> I now see clearly, even as thou seest<br/> Each contradiction to be false and true.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03587">As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,<br/> God in his grace it pleased with this high task<br/> To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03588">And to my Belisarius I commended<br/> The arms, to which was heaven’s right hand so joined<br/> It was a signal that I should repose.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03589">Now here to the first question terminates<br/> My answer; but the character thereof<br/> Constrains me to continue with a sequel,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03590">In order that thou see with how great reason<br/> Men move against the standard sacrosanct,<br/> Both who appropriate and who oppose it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03591">Behold how great a power has made it worthy<br/> Of reverence, beginning from the hour<br/> When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03592">Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode<br/> Three hundred years and upward, till at last<br/> The three to three fought for it yet again.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03593">Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong<br/> Down to Lucretia’s sorrow, in seven kings<br/> O’ercoming round about the neighboring nations;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03594">Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans<br/> Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,<br/> Against the other princes and confederates.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03595">Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br/> Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br/> Received the fame I willingly embalm;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03596">It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,<br/> Who, following Hannibal, had passed across<br/> The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03597">Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young<br/> Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill<br/> Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03598">Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed<br/> To bring the whole world to its mood serene,<br/> Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03599">What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,<br/> Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,<br/> And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03600">What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,<br/> And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight<br/> That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03601">Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then<br/> Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote<br/> That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03602">Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,<br/> It saw again, and there where Hector lies,<br/> And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03603">From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;<br/> Then wheeled itself again into your West,<br/> Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03604">From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer<br/> Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,<br/> And Modena and Perugia dolent were;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03605">Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep<br/> Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,<br/> Took from the adder sudden and black death.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03606">With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;<br/> With him it placed the world in so great peace,<br/> That unto Janus was his temple closed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03607">But what the standard that has made me speak<br/> Achieved before, and after should achieve<br/> Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03608">Becometh in appearance mean and dim,<br/> If in the hand of the third Caesar seen<br/> With eye unclouded and affection pure,<br/></p>
			<p id="id03609">Because the living Justice that inspires me<br/> Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,<br/> The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03610">Now here attend to what I answer thee;<br/> Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance<br/> Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03611">And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten<br/> The Holy Church, then underneath its wings<br/> Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03612">Now hast thou power to judge of such as those<br/> Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,<br/> Which are the cause of all your miseries.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03613">To the public standard one the yellow lilies<br/> Opposes, the other claims it for a party,<br/> So that ’tis hard to see which sins the most.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03614">Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft<br/> Beneath some other standard; for this ever<br/> Ill follows he who it and justice parts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03615">And let not this new Charles e’er strike it down,<br/> He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons<br/> That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03616">Already oftentimes the sons have wept<br/> The father’s crime; and let him not believe<br/> That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03617">This little planet doth adorn itself<br/> With the good spirits that have active been,<br/> That fame and honour might come after them;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03618">And whensoever the desires mount thither,<br/> Thus deviating, must perforce the rays<br/> Of the true love less vividly mount upward.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03619">But in commensuration of our wages<br/> With our desert is portion of our joy,<br/> Because we see them neither less nor greater.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03620">Herein doth living Justice sweeten so<br/> Affection in us, that for evermore<br/> It cannot warp to any iniquity.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03621">Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;<br/> So in this life of ours the seats diverse<br/> Render sweet harmony among these spheres;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03622">And in the compass of this present pearl<br/> Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom<br/> The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.<br/></p>

			<p id="id03624">Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,<br/> Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him<br/> Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03625">And then malicious words incited him<br/> To summon to a reckoning this just man,<br/> Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.<br/></p>
			<p id="id03626">Then he departed poor and stricken in years,<br/> And if the world could know the heart he had,<br/> In begging bit by bit his livelihood,<br/></p>

			<p id="id03640">Now unto what is said direct thy sight;<br/> This nature when united to its Maker,<br/> Such as created, was sincere and good;<br/></p>
			<p id="id03641">But by itself alone was banished forth<br/> From Paradise, because it turned aside<br/> Out of the way of truth and of its life.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04131">Even such was I, and such was I perceived<br/> By Beatrice and by the holy light<br/> That first on my account had changed its place.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04139">Thus did I say unto that selfsame light<br/> That unto me had spoken before; and even<br/> As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04163">When by its silence showed that sainted soul<br/> That it had finished putting in the woof<br/> Into that web which I had given it warped,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04164">Began I, even as he who yearneth after,<br/> Being in doubt, some counsel from a person<br/> Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:<br/></p>

			<p id="id04171">Then made reply: “A conscience overcast<br/> Or with its own or with another’s shame,<br/> Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04179" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was alone rejoicing in its word<br/> That soul beatified, and I was tasting<br/> My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04180">And the Lady who to God was leading me<br/> Said: “Change thy thought; consider that I am<br/> Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04181">Unto the loving accents of my comfort<br/> I turned me round, and then what love I saw<br/> Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04182">Not only that my language I distrust,<br/> But that my mind cannot return so far<br/> Above itself, unless another guide it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04183">Thus much upon that point can I repeat,<br/> That, her again beholding, my affection<br/> From every other longing was released.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04184">While the eternal pleasure, which direct<br/> Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face<br/> Contented me with its reflected aspect,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04185">Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,<br/> She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;<br/> Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04186">Even as sometimes here do we behold<br/> The affection in the look, if it be such<br/> That all the soul is wrapt away by it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04187">So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy<br/> To which I turned, I recognized therein<br/> The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04188">And it began: “In this fifth resting-place<br/> Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<br/> And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04189">Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet<br/> They came to Heaven, were of such great renown<br/> That every Muse therewith would affluent be.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04190">Therefore look thou upon the cross’s horns;<br/> He whom I now shall name will there enact<br/> What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04191">I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn<br/> By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<br/> Nor noted I the word before the deed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04192">And at the name of the great Maccabee<br/> I saw another move itself revolving,<br/> And gladness was the whip unto that top.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04193">Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<br/> Two of them my regard attentive followed<br/> As followeth the eye its falcon flying.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04194">William thereafterward, and Renouard,<br/> And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<br/> Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04195">Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,<br/> The soul that had addressed me showed how great<br/> An artist ’twas among the heavenly singers.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04196">To my right side I turned myself around,<br/> My duty to behold in Beatrice<br/> Either by words or gesture signified;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04197">And so translucent I beheld her eyes,<br/> So full of pleasure, that her countenance<br/> Surpassed its other and its latest wont.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04198">And as, by feeling greater delectation,<br/> A man in doing good from day to day<br/> Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04199">So I became aware that my gyration<br/> With heaven together had increased its arc,<br/> That miracle beholding more adorned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04200">And such as is the change, in little lapse<br/> Of time, in a pale woman, when her face<br/> Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04201">Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<br/> Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,<br/> The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04202">Within that Jovial torch did I behold<br/> The sparkling of the love which was therein<br/> Delineate our language to mine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04203">And even as birds uprisen from the shore,<br/> As in congratulation o’er their food,<br/> Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04204">So from within those lights the holy creatures<br/> Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures<br/> Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04205">First singing they to their own music moved;<br/> Then one becoming of these characters,<br/> A little while they rested and were silent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04206">O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<br/> Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,<br/> And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04207">Illume me with thyself, that I may bring<br/> Their figures out as I have them conceived!<br/> Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04208">Themselves then they displayed in five times seven<br/> Vowels and consonants; and I observed<br/> The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04209">‘Diligite justitiam,’ these were<br/> First verb and noun of all that was depicted;<br/> ‘Qui judicatis terram’ were the last.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04210">Thereafter in the M of the fifth word<br/> Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter<br/> Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04211">And other lights I saw descend where was<br/> The summit of the M, and pause there singing<br/> The good, I think, that draws them to itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04212">Then, as in striking upon burning logs<br/> Upward there fly innumerable sparks,<br/> Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04213">More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<br/> And to ascend, some more, and others less,<br/> Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04214">And, each one being quiet in its place,<br/> The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<br/> Delineated by that inlaid fire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04215">He who there paints has none to be his guide;<br/> But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered<br/> That virtue which is form unto the nest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04216">The other beatitude, that contented seemed<br/> At first to bloom a lily on the M,<br/> By a slight motion followed out the imprint.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04217">O gentle star! what and how many gems<br/> Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice<br/> Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04218">Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin<br/> Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard<br/> Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04219">So that a second time it now be wroth<br/> With buying and with selling in the temple<br/> Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04220">O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,<br/> Implore for those who are upon the earth<br/> All gone astray after the bad example!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04221">Once ’twas the custom to make war with swords;<br/> But now ’tis made by taking here and there<br/> The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04222">Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think<br/> That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard<br/> Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04223">Well canst thou say: “So steadfast my desire<br/> Is unto him who willed to live alone,<br/> And for a dance was led to martyrdom,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04224">That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.”</p>

			<p id="id04227">Appeared a little ruby each, wherein<br/> Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled<br/> That each into mine eyes refracted it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04228">And what it now behoves me to retrace<br/> Nor voice has e’er reported, nor ink written,<br/> Nor was by fantasy e’er comprehended;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04230">And it began: “Being just and merciful<br/> Am I exalted here unto that glory<br/> Which cannot be exceeded by desire;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04232">So doth a single heat from many embers<br/> Make itself felt, even as from many loves<br/> Issued a single sound from out that image.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04233">Whence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers<br/> Of the eternal joy, that only one<br/> Make me perceive your odours manifold,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04234">Exhaling, break within me the great fast<br/> Which a long season has in hunger held me,<br/> Not finding for it any food on earth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04235">Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<br/> Justice Divine another realm doth make,<br/> Yours apprehends it not through any veil.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04236">You know how I attentively address me<br/> To listen; and you know what is the doubt<br/> That is in me so very old a fast.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04237">Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,<br/> Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,<br/> Showing desire, and making himself fine,<br/></p>

			<p id="id04239">Then it began: “He who a compass turned<br/> On the world’s outer verge, and who within it<br/> Devised so much occult and manifest,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04240">Could not the impress of his power so make<br/> On all the universe, as that his Word<br/> Should not remain in infinite excess.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04241">And this makes certain that the first proud being,<br/> Who was the paragon of every creature,<br/> By not awaiting light fell immature.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04242">And hence appears it, that each minor nature<br/> Is scant receptacle unto that good<br/> Which has no end, and by itself is measured.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04243">In consequence our vision, which perforce<br/> Must be some ray of that intelligence<br/> With which all things whatever are replete,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04244">Cannot in its own nature be so potent,<br/> That it shall not its origin discern<br/> Far beyond that which is apparent to it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04245">Therefore into the justice sempiternal<br/> The power of vision that your world receives,<br/> As eye into the ocean, penetrates;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04246">Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,<br/> Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet<br/> ’Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04247">There is no light but comes from the serene<br/> That never is o’ercast, nay, it is darkness<br/> Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04248">Amply to thee is opened now the cavern<br/> Which has concealed from thee the living justice<br/> Of which thou mad’st such frequent questioning.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04249">For saidst thou: ‘Born a man is on the shore<br/> Of Indus, and is none who there can speak<br/> Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04250">And all his inclinations and his actions<br/> Are good, so far as human reason sees,<br/> Without a sin in life or in discourse:<br/></p>
			<p id="id04251">He dieth unbaptised and without faith;<br/> Where is this justice that condemneth him?<br/> Where is his fault, if he do not believe?’<br/></p>
			<p id="id04252">Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit<br/> In judgment at a thousand miles away,<br/> With the short vision of a single span?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04253">Truly to him who with me subtilizes,<br/> If so the Scripture were not over you,<br/> For doubting there were marvellous occasion.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04254">O animals terrene, O stolid minds,<br/> The primal will, that in itself is good,<br/> Ne’er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04255">So much is just as is accordant with it;<br/> No good created draws it to itself,<br/> But it, by raying forth, occasions that.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04256">Even as above her nest goes circling round<br/> The stork when she has fed her little ones,<br/> And he who has been fed looks up at her,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04257">So lifted I my brows, and even such<br/> Became the blessed image, which its wings<br/> Was moving, by so many counsels urged.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04288">For of the fires of which I make my figure,<br/> Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head<br/> Of all their orders the supremest are.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04289">He who is shining in the midst as pupil<br/> Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,<br/> Who bore the ark from city unto city;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04290">Now knoweth he the merit of his song,<br/> In so far as effect of his own counsel,<br/> By the reward which is commensurate.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04291">Of five, that make a circle for my brow,<br/> He that approacheth nearest to my beak<br/> Did the poor widow for her son console;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04292">Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost<br/> Not following Christ, by the experience<br/> Of this sweet life and of its opposite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04293">He who comes next in the circumference<br/> Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,<br/> Did death postpone by penitence sincere;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04294">Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment<br/> Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer<br/> Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04295">The next who follows, with the laws and me,<br/> Under the good intent that bore bad fruit<br/> Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04296">Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced<br/> From his good action is not harmful to him,<br/> Although the world thereby may be destroyed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04297">And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,<br/> Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores<br/> That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04298">Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is<br/> With a just king; and in the outward show<br/> Of his effulgence he reveals it still.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04299">Who would believe, down in the errant world,<br/> That e’er the Trojan Ripheus in this round<br/> Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04300">Now knoweth he enough of what the world<br/> Has not the power to see of grace divine,<br/> Although his sight may not discern the bottom.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04301">Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,<br/> First singing and then silent with content<br/> Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04302">Such seemed to me the image of the imprint<br/> Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will<br/> Doth everything become the thing it is.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04303">And notwithstanding to my doubt I was<br/> As glass is to the colour that invests it,<br/> To wait the time in silence it endured not,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04304">But forth from out my mouth, “What things are these?”<br/> Extorted with the force of its own weight;<br/> Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04305">Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled<br/> The blessed standard made to me reply,<br/> To keep me not in wonderment suspended:<br/></p>
			<p id="id04306">“I see that thou believest in these things<br/> Because I say them, but thou seest not how;<br/> So that, although believed in, they are hidden.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04307">Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name<br/> Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity<br/> Cannot perceive, unless another show it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04308">‘Regnum coelorum’ suffereth violence<br/> From fervent love, and from that living hope<br/> That overcometh the Divine volition;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04309">Not in the guise that man o’ercometh man,<br/> But conquers it because it will be conquered,<br/> And conquered conquers by benignity.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04310">The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<br/> Cause thee astonishment, because with them<br/> Thou seest the region of the angels painted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04311">They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,<br/> Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith<br/> Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04312">For one from Hell, where no one e’er turns back<br/> Unto good will, returned unto his bones,<br/> And that of living hope was the reward⁠—<br/></p>
			<p id="id04313">Of living hope, that placed its efficacy<br/> In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,<br/> So that ’twere possible to move his will.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04314">The glorious soul concerning which I speak,<br/> Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,<br/> Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04315">And, in believing, kindled to such fire<br/> Of genuine love, that at the second death<br/> Worthy it was to come unto this joy.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04316">The other one, through grace, that from so deep<br/> A fountain wells that never hath the eye<br/> Of any creature reached its primal wave,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04317">Set all his love below on righteousness;<br/> Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose<br/> His eye to our redemption yet to be,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04318">Whence he believed therein, and suffered not<br/> From that day forth the stench of paganism,<br/> And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04319">Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<br/> Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism<br/> More than a thousand years before baptizing.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04320">O thou predestination, how remote<br/> Thy root is from the aspect of all those<br/> Who the First Cause do not behold entire!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04321">And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained<br/> In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,<br/> We do not know as yet all the elect;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04322">And sweet to us is such a deprivation,<br/> Because our good in this good is made perfect,<br/> That whatsoe’er God wills, we also will.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04323">After this manner by that shape divine,<br/> To make clear in me my short-sightedness,<br/> Was given to me a pleasant medicine;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04324">And as good singer a good lutanist<br/> Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,<br/> Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04325">So, while it spake, do I remember me<br/> That I beheld both of those blessed lights,<br/> Even as the winking of the eyes concords,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04326">Moving unto the words their little flames.</p>

			<p id="id04338">Likewise beheld I down the steps descending<br/> So many splendours, that I thought each light<br/> That in the heaven appears was there diffused.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04339">And as accordant with their natural custom<br/> The rooks together at the break of day<br/> Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04342">And that which nearest unto us remained<br/> Became so clear, that in my thought I said,<br/> “Well I perceive the love thou showest me;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04344">She thereupon, who saw my silentness<br/> In the sight of Him who seeth everything,<br/> Said unto me, “Let loose thy warm desire.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04345">And I began: “No merit of my own<br/> Renders me worthy of response from thee;<br/> But for her sake who granteth me the asking,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04346">Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed<br/> In thy beatitude, make known to me<br/> The cause which draweth thee so near my side;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04347">And tell me why is silent in this wheel<br/> The dulcet symphony of Paradise,<br/> That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04348">“Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,”<br/> It answer made to me; “they sing not here,<br/> For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04349">Thus far adown the holy stairway’s steps<br/> Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br/> With words, and with the light that mantles me;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04351">But the high charity, that makes us servants<br/> Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br/> Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04352">“I see full well,” said I, “O sacred lamp!<br/> How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br/> To follow the eternal Providence;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04354">No sooner had I come to the last word,<br/> Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br/> Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04355">When answer made the love that was therein:<br/> “On me directed is a light divine,<br/> Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04356">Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br/> Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br/> The supreme essence from which this is drawn.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04357">Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br/> For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br/> The clearness of the flame I equal make.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04358">But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br/> That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br/> Could this demand of thine not satisfy;<br/></p>

			<p id="id04362">Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br/> The question I relinquished, and restricted<br/> Myself to ask it humbly who it was.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04365">Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br/> And then, continuing, it said: “Therein<br/> Unto God’s service I became so steadfast,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04366">That feeding only on the juice of olives<br/> Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br/> Contented in my thoughts contemplative.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04373">At this voice saw I many little flames<br/> From step to step descending and revolving,<br/> And every revolution made them fairer.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04374">Round about this one came they and stood still,<br/> And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br/> It here could find no parallel, nor I<br/></p>

			<p id="id04379">Said to me: “Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br/> And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br/> And what is done here cometh from good zeal?<br/></p>

			<p id="id04384">As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br/> And saw a hundred spherules that together<br/> With mutual rays each other more embellished.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04385">I stood as one who in himself represses<br/> The point of his desire, and ventures not<br/> To question, he so feareth the too much.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04386">And now the largest and most luculent<br/> Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br/> Make my desire concerning it content.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04387">Within it then I heard: “If thou couldst see<br/> Even as myself the charity that burns<br/> Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04388">But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br/> To the high end, I will make answer even<br/> Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04392">These other fires, each one of them, were men<br/> Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br/> Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04393">Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br/> Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br/> Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04394">And I to him: “The affection which thou showest<br/> Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br/> Which I behold and note in all your ardours,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04395">In me have so my confidence dilated<br/> As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br/> As far unfolded as it hath the power.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04396">Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br/> If I may so much grace receive, that I<br/> May thee behold with countenance unveiled.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04397">He thereupon: “Brother, thy high desire<br/> In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br/> Where are fulfilled all others and my own.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04398">There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br/> Every desire; within that one alone<br/> Is every part where it has always been;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04399">For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br/> And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br/> Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04400">Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br/> Extending its supernal part, what time<br/> So thronged with angels it appeared to him.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04401">But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br/> His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br/> Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04445">“Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br/> Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br/> Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04446">I was as one who still retains the feeling<br/> Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br/> In vain to bring it back into his mind,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04447">When I this invitation heard, deserving<br/> Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br/> Out of the book that chronicles the past.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04448">If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br/> That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br/> Most lubrical with their delicious milk,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04449">To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br/> It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br/> And how the holy aspect it illumed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04450">And therefore, representing Paradise,<br/> The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br/> Even as a man who finds his way cut off;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04451">But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br/> And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br/> Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04452">It is no passage for a little boat<br/> This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br/> Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04453">“Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br/> That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br/> Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04454">There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br/> Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br/> By whose perfume the good way was discovered.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04455">Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br/> Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br/> Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04456">As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br/> Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br/> Mine eyes with shadow covered o’er have seen,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04457">So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br/> Illumined from above with burning rays,<br/> Beholding not the source of the effulgence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04458">O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br/> Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br/> There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04459">The name of that fair flower I e’er invoke<br/> Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br/> My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04460">And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br/> The glory and greatness of the living star<br/> Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04461">Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br/> Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br/> And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04462">Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br/> On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br/> Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04463">Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br/> Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br/> Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04464">“I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br/> The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br/> That was the hostelry of our Desire;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04465">And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br/> Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner<br/> The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04466">Thus did the circulated melody<br/> Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br/> Were making to resound the name of Mary.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04467">The regal mantle of the volumes all<br/> Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br/> With breath of God and with his works and ways,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04468">Extended over us its inner border,<br/> So very distant, that the semblance of it<br/> There where I was not yet appeared to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04469">Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br/> Of following the incoronated flame,<br/> Which mounted upward near to its own seed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04470">And as a little child, that towards its mother<br/> Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br/> Through impulse kindled into outward flame,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04471">Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br/> So with its summit, that the deep affection<br/> They had for Mary was revealed to me.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04472">Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br/> ‘Regina coeli’ singing with such sweetness,<br/> That ne’er from me has the delight departed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04473">O, what exuberance is garnered up<br/> Within those richest coffers, which had been<br/> Good husbandmen for sowing here below!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04474">There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br/> Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br/> Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04475">There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br/> Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br/> Both with the ancient council and the new,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04476">He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p>

			<p id="id04481">Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br/> Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br/> Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04482">And as the wheels in works of horologes<br/> Revolve so that the first to the beholder<br/> Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,<br/></p>

			<p id="id04485">And around Beatrice three several times<br/> It whirled itself with so divine a song,<br/> My fantasy repeats it not to me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04486">Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br/> Since our imagination for such folds,<br/> Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04487">“O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br/> With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br/> Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04488">Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br/> Unto my Lady did direct its breath,<br/> Which spake in fashion as I here have said.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04489">And she: “O light eterne of the great man<br/> To whom our Lord delivered up the keys<br/> He carried down of this miraculous joy,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04490">This one examine on points light and grave,<br/> As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith<br/> By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04493">As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not<br/> Until the master doth propose the question,<br/> To argue it, and not to terminate it,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04494">So did I arm myself with every reason,<br/> While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br/> For such a questioner and such profession.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04495">“Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br/> What is the Faith?” Whereat I raised my brow<br/> Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04496">Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br/> Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br/> The water forth from my internal fountain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04497">“May grace, that suffers me to make confession,”<br/> Began I, “to the great centurion,<br/> Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04498">And I continued: “As the truthful pen,<br/> Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br/> Who put with thee Rome into the good way,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04499">Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br/> And evidence of those that are not seen;<br/> And this appears to me its quiddity.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04500">Then heard I: “Very rightly thou perceivest,<br/> If well thou understandest why he placed it<br/> With substances and then with evidences.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04501">And I thereafterward: “The things profound,<br/> That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br/> Unto all eyes below are so concealed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04502">That they exist there only in belief,<br/> Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br/> And hence it takes the nature of a substance.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04503">And it behoveth us from this belief<br/> To reason without having other sight,<br/> And hence it has the nature of evidence.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04504">Then heard I: “If whatever is acquired<br/> Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br/> No sophist’s subtlety would there find place.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04505">Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br/> Then added: “Very well has been gone over<br/> Already of this coin the alloy and weight;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04506">But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?”<br/> And I: “Yes, both so shining and so round<br/> That in its stamp there is no peradventure.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04507">Thereafter issued from the light profound<br/> That there resplendent was: “This precious jewel,<br/> Upon the which is every virtue founded,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04508">Whence hadst thou it?” And I: “The large outpouring<br/> Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br/> Upon the ancient parchments and the new,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04509">A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br/> With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br/> All demonstration seems to me obtuse.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04510">And then I heard: “The ancient and the new<br/> Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br/> Why dost thou take them for the word divine?”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04511">And I: “The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br/> Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br/> Ne’er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04512">’Twas answered me: “Say, who assureth thee<br/> That those works ever were? the thing itself<br/> That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04513">“Were the world to Christianity converted,”<br/> I said, “withouten miracles, this one<br/> Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04514">Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br/> Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br/> Which was a vine and has become a thorn!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04515">This being finished, the high, holy Court<br/> Resounded through the spheres, “One God we praise!”<br/> In melody that there above is chanted.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04516">And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br/> Examining, had thus conducted me,<br/> Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04517">Again began: “The Grace that dallying<br/> Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br/> Up to this point, as it should opened be,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04518">So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br/> But now thou must express what thou believest,<br/> And whence to thy belief it was presented.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04519">“O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br/> What thou believedst so that thou o’ercamest,<br/> Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04520">Began I, “thou dost wish me in this place<br/> The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br/> And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04521">And I respond: In one God I believe,<br/> Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br/> With love and with desire, himself unmoved;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04522">And of such faith not only have I proofs<br/> Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br/> Likewise the truth that from this place rains down<br/></p>
			<p id="id04523">Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br/> Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br/> After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04524">In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br/> One essence I believe, so one and trine<br/> They bear conjunction both with ‘sunt’ and ‘est.’<br/></p>
			<p id="id04525">With the profound condition and divine<br/> Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br/> Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04526">This the beginning is, this is the spark<br/> Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br/> And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04527">Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br/> His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br/> For the good news as soon as he is silent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04528">So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br/> Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br/> The apostolic light, at whose command<br/></p>
			<p id="id04529">I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p>

			<p id="id04533">With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<br/> Poet will I return, and at my font<br/> Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04534">Because into the Faith that maketh known<br/> All souls to God there entered I, and then<br/> Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04535">Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br/> Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br/> Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04536">And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br/> Said unto me: “Look, look! behold the Baron<br/> For whom below Galicia is frequented.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04537">In the same way as, when a dove alights<br/> Near his companion, both of them pour forth,<br/> Circling about and murmuring, their affection,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04538">So one beheld I by the other grand<br/> Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,<br/> Lauding the food that there above is eaten.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04539">But when their gratulations were complete,<br/> Silently ‘coram me’ each one stood still,<br/> So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04540">Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br/> “Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br/> Of our Basilica have been described,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04541">Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br/> Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<br/> As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”⁠—<br/></p>
			<p id="id04542">“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br/> For what comes hither from the mortal world<br/> Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04543">This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br/> Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br/> Which bent them down before with too great weight.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04544">“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br/> Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,<br/> In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,<br/></p>

			<p id="id04546">Say what it is, and how is flowering with it<br/> Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”<br/> Thus did the second light again continue.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04547">And the Compassionate, who piloted<br/> The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br/> Did in reply anticipate me thus:<br/></p>
			<p id="id04548">“No child whatever the Church Militant<br/> Of greater hope possesses, as is written<br/> In that Sun which irradiates all our band;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04549">Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt<br/> To come into Jerusalem to see,<br/> Or ever yet his warfare be completed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04550">The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br/> Have been demanded, but that he report<br/> How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04551">To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br/> Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br/> And may the grace of God in this assist him!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04552">As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br/> Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br/> That his proficiency may be displayed,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04553">“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation<br/> Of future glory, which is the effect<br/> Of grace divine and merit precedent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04554">From many stars this light comes unto me;<br/> But he instilled it first into my heart<br/> Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04555">‘Sperent in te,’ in the high Theody<br/> He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name;’ and who<br/> Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04556">Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling<br/> In the Epistle, so that I am full,<br/> And upon others rain again your rain.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04557">While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br/> Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br/> Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04558">Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed<br/> Towards the virtue still which followed me<br/> Unto the palm and issue of the field,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04559">Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br/> In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br/> Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04560">And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new<br/> The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br/> Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04561">Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<br/> In his own land shall be with twofold garments,<br/> And his own land is this delightful life.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04562">Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,<br/> There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br/> This revelation manifests to us.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04563">And first, and near the ending of these words,<br/> “Sperent in te” from over us was heard,<br/> To which responsive answered all the carols.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04564">Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br/> So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br/> Winter would have a month of one sole day.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04565">And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br/> A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br/> To the new bride, and not from any failing,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04566">Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br/> Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br/> As was beseeming to their ardent love.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04567">Into the song and music there it entered;<br/> And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br/> Even as a bride silent and motionless.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04568">“This is the one who lay upon the breast<br/> Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br/> To the great office from the cross elected.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04569">My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br/> Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br/> Before or afterward these words of hers.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04570">Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br/> To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br/> And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04571">So I became before that latest fire,<br/> While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself<br/> To see a thing which here hath no existence?<br/></p>
			<p id="id04572">Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br/> With all the others there, until our number<br/> With the eternal proposition tallies.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04573">With the two garments in the blessed cloister<br/> Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<br/> And this shalt thou take back into your world.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04574">And at this utterance the flaming circle<br/> Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling<br/> Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04575">As to escape from danger or fatigue<br/> The oars that erst were in the water beaten<br/> Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04576">Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,<br/> When I turned round to look on Beatrice,<br/> That her I could not see, although I was<br/></p>
			<p id="id04577">Close at her side and in the Happy World!</p>

			<p id="id04579" style="margin-top: 2em">While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<br/> Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it<br/> Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04580">Saying: “While thou recoverest the sense<br/> Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,<br/> ’Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04581">Begin then, and declare to what thy soul<br/> Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,<br/> Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04582">Because the Lady, who through this divine<br/> Region conducteth thee, has in her look<br/> The power the hand of Ananias had.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04583">I said: “As pleaseth her, or soon or late<br/> Let the cure come to eyes that portals were<br/> When she with fire I ever burn with entered.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04584">The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,<br/> The Alpha and Omega is of all<br/> The writing that love reads me low or loud.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04585">The selfsame voice, that taken had from me<br/> The terror of the sudden dazzlement,<br/> To speak still farther put it in my thought;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04586">And said: “In verity with finer sieve<br/> Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth<br/> To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04587">And I: “By philosophic arguments,<br/> And by authority that hence descends,<br/> Such love must needs imprint itself in me;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04588">For Good, so far as good, when comprehended<br/> Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater<br/> As more of goodness in itself it holds;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04589">Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage<br/> That every good which out of it is found<br/> Is nothing but a ray of its own light)<br/></p>
			<p id="id04590">More than elsewhither must the mind be moved<br/> Of every one, in loving, who discerns<br/> The truth in which this evidence is founded.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04591">Such truth he to my intellect reveals<br/> Who demonstrates to me the primal love<br/> Of all the sempiternal substances.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04592">The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,<br/> Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,<br/> ‘I will make all my goodness pass before thee.’<br/></p>
			<p id="id04593">Thou too revealest it to me, beginning<br/> The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<br/> Of heaven to earth above all other edict.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04594">And I heard say: “By human intellect<br/> And by authority concordant with it,<br/> Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04595">But say again if other cords thou feelest,<br/> Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim<br/> With how many teeth this love is biting thee.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04596">The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<br/> Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived<br/> Whither he fain would my profession lead.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04597">Therefore I recommenced: “All of those bites<br/> Which have the power to turn the heart to God<br/> Unto my charity have been concurrent.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04598">The being of the world, and my own being,<br/> The death which He endured that I may live,<br/> And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04599">With the forementioned vivid consciousness<br/> Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,<br/> And of the right have placed me on the shore.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04601">As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet<br/> Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady<br/> Said with the others, “Holy, holy, holy!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04602">And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep<br/> By reason of the visual spirit that runs<br/> Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04603">And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,<br/> So all unconscious is his sudden waking,<br/> Until the judgment cometh to his aid,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04604">So from before mine eyes did Beatrice<br/> Chase every mote with radiance of her own,<br/> That cast its light a thousand miles and more.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04605">Whence better after than before I saw,<br/> And in a kind of wonderment I asked<br/> About a fourth light that I saw with us.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04606">And said my Lady: “There within those rays<br/> Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<br/> That ever the first virtue did create.”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04607">Even as the bough that downward bends its top<br/> At transit of the wind, and then is lifted<br/> By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04608">Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,<br/> Being amazed, and then I was made bold<br/> By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04609">And I began: “O apple, that mature<br/> Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,<br/> To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,<br/></p>

			<p id="id04612">And in like manner the primeval soul<br/> Made clear to me athwart its covering<br/> How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04613">Then breathed: “Without thy uttering it to me,<br/> Thine inclination better I discern<br/> Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04614">For I behold it in the truthful mirror,<br/> That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<br/> And none makes Him parhelion of itself.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04615">Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me<br/> Within the lofty garden, where this Lady<br/> Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04616">And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,<br/> And of the great disdain the proper cause,<br/> And the language that I used and that I made.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04617">Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree<br/> Not in itself was cause of so great exile,<br/> But solely the o’erstepping of the bounds.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04620">The language that I spake was quite extinct<br/> Before that in the work interminable<br/> The people under Nimrod were employed;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04621">For nevermore result of reasoning<br/> (Because of human pleasure that doth change,<br/> Obedient to the heavens) was durable.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04623">Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,<br/> ‘El’ was on earth the name of the Chief Good,<br/> From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round<br/></p>

			<p id="id04700">The circles corporal are wide and narrow<br/> According to the more or less of virtue<br/> Which is distributed through all their parts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04701">The greater goodness works the greater weal,<br/> The greater weal the greater body holds,<br/> If perfect equally are all its parts.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04702">Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<br/> The universe sublime, doth correspond<br/> Unto the circle which most loves and knows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04703">On which account, if thou unto the virtue<br/> Apply thy measure, not to the appearance<br/> Of substances that unto thee seem round,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04704">Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,<br/> Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<br/> In every heaven, with its Intelligence.”<br/></p>

			<p id="id04719">The three Divine are in this hierarchy,<br/> First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<br/> And the third order is that of the Powers.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04720">Then in the dances twain penultimate<br/> The Principalities and Archangels wheel;<br/> The last is wholly of angelic sports.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04721">These orders upward all of them are gazing,<br/> And downward so prevail, that unto God<br/> They all attracted are and all attract.<br/></p>

			<p id="id04852">Not from that region which the highest thunders<br/> Is any mortal eye so far removed,<br/> In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04853">As there from Beatrice my sight; but this<br/> Was nothing unto me; because her image<br/> Descended not to me by medium blurred.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04854">“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,<br/> And who for my salvation didst endure<br/> In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,<br/></p>

			<p id="id04921">Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,<br/> So well content to look upon her daughter,<br/> Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04922">And opposite the eldest household father<br/> Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br/> When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04923">But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br/> Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br/> Who makes the gown according to his cloth,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04924">And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,<br/> That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br/> As far as possible through his effulgence.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04925">Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br/> Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br/> By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04926">Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br/> And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br/> That from my words thy heart turn not aside.”<br/></p>

			<p id="id04928" style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIII</span></p>
			<p id="id04929" style="margin-top: 2em">“Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<br/> Humble and high beyond all other creature,<br/> The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04930">Thou art the one who such nobility<br/> To human nature gave, that its Creator<br/> Did not disdain to make himself its creature.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04931">Within thy womb rekindled was the love,<br/> By heat of which in the eternal peace<br/> After such wise this flower has germinated.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04932">Here unto us thou art a noonday torch<br/> Of charity, and below there among mortals<br/> Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04933">Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,<br/> That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,<br/> His aspirations without wings would fly.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04934">Not only thy benignity gives succour<br/> To him who asketh it, but oftentimes<br/> Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04935">In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,<br/> In thee magnificence; in thee unites<br/> Whate’er of goodness is in any creature.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04936">Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth<br/> Of the universe as far as here has seen<br/> One after one the spiritual lives,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04937">Supplicate thee through grace for so much power<br/> That with his eyes he may uplift himself<br/> Higher towards the uttermost salvation.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04938">And I, who never burned for my own seeing<br/> More than I do for his, all of my prayers<br/> Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04939">That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud<br/> Of his mortality so with thy prayers,<br/> That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04940">Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst<br/> Whate’er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve<br/> After so great a vision his affections.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04941">Let thy protection conquer human movements;<br/> See Beatrice and all the blessed ones<br/> My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!”<br/></p>
			<p id="id04942">The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br/> Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us<br/> How grateful unto her are prayers devout;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04943">Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,<br/> On which it is not credible could be<br/> By any creature bent an eye so clear.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04944">And I, who to the end of all desires<br/> Was now approaching, even as I ought<br/> The ardour of desire within me ended.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04945">Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,<br/> That I should upward look; but I already<br/> Was of my own accord such as he wished;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04946">Because my sight, becoming purified,<br/> Was entering more and more into the ray<br/> Of the High Light which of itself is true.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04947">From that time forward what I saw was greater<br/> Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br/> And yields the memory unto such excess.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04948">Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br/> And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br/> Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04949">Even such am I, for almost utterly<br/> Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br/> Within my heart the sweetness born of it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04950">Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br/> Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br/> Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04951">O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee<br/> From the conceits of mortals, to my mind<br/> Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04952">And make my tongue of so great puissance,<br/> That but a single sparkle of thy glory<br/> It may bequeath unto the future people;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04953">For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br/> And by a little sounding in these verses,<br/> More of thy victory shall be conceived!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04954">I think the keenness of the living ray<br/> Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br/> If but mine eyes had been averted from it;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04955">And I remember that I was more bold<br/> On this account to bear, so that I joined<br/> My aspect with the Glory Infinite.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04956">O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br/> To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br/> So that the seeing I consumed therein!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04957">I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br/> Bound up with love together in one volume,<br/> What through the universe in leaves is scattered;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04958">Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br/> All interfused together in such wise<br/> That what I speak of is one simple light.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04959">The universal fashion of this knot<br/> Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br/> In saying this I feel that I rejoice.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04960">One moment is more lethargy to me,<br/> Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br/> That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04961">My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br/> Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br/> And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04962">In presence of that light one such becomes,<br/> That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br/> It is impossible he e’er consent;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04963">Because the good, which object is of will,<br/> Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br/> That is defective which is perfect there.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04964">Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br/> Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s<br/> Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04965">Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br/> Was in the living light on which I looked,<br/> For it is always what it was before;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04966">But through the sight, that fortified itself<br/> In me by looking, one appearance only<br/> To me was ever changing as I changed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04967">Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br/> Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br/> Of threefold colour and of one dimension,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04968">And by the second seemed the first reflected<br/> As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br/> Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04969">O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br/> Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br/> Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04970">O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br/> Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br/> And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!<br/></p>
			<p id="id04971">That circulation, which being thus conceived<br/> Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br/> When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04972">Within itself, of its own very colour<br/> Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br/> Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04973">As the geometrician, who endeavours<br/> To square the circle, and discovers not,<br/> By taking thought, the principle he wants,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04974">Even such was I at that new apparition;<br/> I wished to see how the image to the circle<br/> Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;<br/></p>
			<p id="id04975">But my own wings were not enough for this,<br/> Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br/> A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<br/></p>
			<p id="id04976">Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br/> But now was turning my desire and will,<br/> Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<br/></p>
			<p id="id04977">The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</p>

			<h4 id="id04980" style="margin-top: 2em">I</h4>
			<p id="id04981">Oft have I seen at some cathedral door<br/> A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,<br/> Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet<br/> Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor<br/> Kneel to repeat his paternoster o’er;<br/> Far off the noises of the world retreat;<br/> The loud vociferations of the street<br/> Become an undistinguishable roar.<br/> So, as I enter here from day to day,<br/> And leave my burden at this minster gate,<br/> Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,<br/> The tumult of the time disconsolate<br/> To inarticulate murmurs dies away,<br/> While the eternal ages watch and wait.<br/></p>
			<h4 id="id04982" style="margin-top: 2em">II</h4>
			<p id="id04983">How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!<br/> This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves<br/> Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves<br/> Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,<br/> And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!<br/> But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves<br/> Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,<br/> And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!<br/> Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,<br/> What exultations trampling on despair,<br/> What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br/> What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br/> Uprose this poem of the earth and air,<br/> This mediaeval miracle of song!<br/></p>
			<h4 id="id04984" style="margin-top: 2em">III</h4>
			<p id="id04985">I enter, and I see thee in the gloom<br/> Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!<br/> And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.<br/> The air is filled with some unknown perfume;<br/> The congregation of the dead make room<br/> For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;<br/> Like rooks that haunt Ravenna’s groves of pine,<br/> The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.<br/> From the confessionals I hear arise<br/> Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,<br/> And lamentations from the crypts below<br/> And then a voice celestial that begins<br/> With the pathetic words, “Although your sins<br/> As scarlet be,” and ends with “as the snow.”<br/></p>
			<h4 id="id04986" style="margin-top: 2em">IV</h4>
			<p id="id04987">With snow-white veil, and garments as of flame,<br/> She stands before thee, who so long ago<br/> Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe<br/> From which thy song in all its splendors came;<br/> And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,<br/> The ice about thy heart melts as the snow<br/> On mountain heights, and in swift overflow<br/> Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.<br/> Thou makest full confession; and a gleam<br/> As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,<br/> Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;<br/> Lethe and Eunoe⁠—the remembered dream<br/> And the forgotten sorrow⁠—bring at last<br/> That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.<br/></p>
			<h4 id="id04988" style="margin-top: 2em">V</h4>
			<p id="id04989">I Lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze<br/> With forms of saints and holy men who died,<br/> Here martyred and hereafter glorified;<br/> And the great Rose upon its leaves displays<br/> Christ’s Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,<br/> With splendor upon splendor multiplied;<br/> And Beatrice again at Dante’s side<br/> No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.<br/> And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs<br/> Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love<br/> And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;<br/> And the melodious bells among the spires<br/> O’er all the house-tops and through heaven above<br/> Proclaim the elevation of the Host!<br/></p>

			<p id="id04991">O star of morning and of liberty!<br/> O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines<br/> Above the darkness of the Apennines,<br/> Forerunner of the day that is to be!<br/> The voices of the city and the sea,<br/> The voices of the mountains and the pines,<br/> Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines<br/> Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!<br/> Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,<br/> Through all the nations; and a sound is heard,<br/> As of a mighty wind, and men devout,<br/> Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,<br/> In their own language hear thy wondrous word,<br/> And many are amazed and many doubt.<br/></p>
