<h5 id="id01693">PURGATORIO</h5>
<p id="id01694" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto I</p>
<p id="id01695" style="margin-top: 2em">To run o'er better waters hoists its sail<br/>

  The little vessel of my genius now,<br/>

  That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01696">And of that second kingdom will I sing<br/>

  Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br/>

  And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01697">But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br/>

  O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br/>

  And here Calliope somewhat ascend,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01698">My song accompanying with that sound,<br/>

  Of which the miserable magpies felt<br/>

  The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01699">Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br/>

  That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br/>

  Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01700">Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br/>

  Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br/>

  Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01701">The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br/>

  Was making all the orient to laugh,<br/>

  Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01702">To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/>

  Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/>

  Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01703">Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/>

  O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/>

  Because thou art deprived of seeing these!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01704">When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/>

  Turning a little to the other pole,<br/>

  There where the Wain had disappeared already,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01705">I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/>

  Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/>

  That more owes not to father any son.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01706">A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/>

  He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/>

  Of which a double list fell on his breast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01707">The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/>

  Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/>

  That him I saw as were the sun before him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01708">"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/>

  Have fled away from the eternal prison?"<br/>

  Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01709">"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/>

  In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/>

  That ever black makes the infernal valley?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01710">The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br/>

  Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/>

  That being damned ye come unto my crags?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01711">Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/>

  And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/>

  Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01712">Then answered him: "I came not of myself;<br/>

  A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/>

  I aided this one with my company.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01713">But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/>

  Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/>

  Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01714">This one has never his last evening seen,<br/>

  But by his folly was so near to it<br/>

  That very little time was there to turn.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01715">As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/>

  To rescue him, and other way was none<br/>

  Than this to which I have myself betaken.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01716">I've shown him all the people of perdition,<br/>

  And now those spirits I intend to show<br/>

  Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01717">How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/>

  Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/>

  To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01718">Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/>

  He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/>

  As knoweth he who life for her refuses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01719">Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/>

  Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br/>

  The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01720">By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br/>

  Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br/>

  But of that circle I, where are the chaste<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01721">Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br/>

  O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/>

  For her love, then, incline thyself to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01722">Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/>

  I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/>

  If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01723">"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/>

  While I was on the other side," then said he,<br/>

  "That every grace she wished of me I granted;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01724">Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/>

  She can no longer move me, by that law<br/>

  Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01725">But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br/>

  As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/>

  Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01726">Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/>

  With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/>

  So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01727">For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast<br/>

  By any mist should go before the first<br/>

  Angel, who is of those of Paradise.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01728">This little island round about its base<br/>

  Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br/>

  Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01729">No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br/>

  Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br/>

  Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01730">Thereafter be not this way your return;<br/>

  The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/>

  To take the mount by easier ascent."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01731">With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/>

  Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/>

  Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01732">And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;<br/>

  Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/>

  The plain unto its lower boundaries."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01733">The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/>

  Which fled before it, so that from afar<br/>

  I recognised the trembling of the sea.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01734">Along the solitary plain we went<br/>

  As one who unto the lost road returns,<br/>

  And till he finds it seems to go in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01735">As soon as we were come to where the dew<br/>

  Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br/>

  Where shadow falls, little evaporates,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01736">Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br/>

  In gentle manner did my Master place;<br/>

  Whence I, who of his action was aware,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01737">Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/>

  There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/>

  That hue which Hell had covered up in me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01738">Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/>

  Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/>

  Any that afterward had known return.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01739">There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br/>

  O marvellous! for even as he culled<br/>

  The humble plant, such it sprang up again<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01740">Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>
<p id="id01741" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto II</p>
<p id="id01742" style="margin-top: 2em">Already had the sun the horizon reached<br/>

  Whose circle of meridian covers o'er<br/>

  Jerusalem with its most lofty point,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01743">And night that opposite to him revolves<br/>

  Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br/>

  That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01744">So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br/>

  Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br/>

  By too great age were changing into orange.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01745">We still were on the border of the sea,<br/>

  Like people who are thinking of their road,<br/>

  Who go in heart and with the body stay;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01746">And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br/>

  Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br/>

  Down in the West upon the ocean floor,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01747">Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—<br/>

  A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br/>

  Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01748">From which when I a little had withdrawn<br/>

  Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br/>

  Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01749">Then on each side of it appeared to me<br/>

  I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br/>

  Little by little there came forth another.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01750">My Master yet had uttered not a word<br/>

  While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/>

  But when he clearly recognised the pilot,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01751">He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/>

  Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br/>

  Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01752">See how he scorneth human arguments,<br/>

  So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br/>

  Than his own wings, between so distant shores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01753">See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br/>

  Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br/>

  That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01754">Then as still nearer and more near us came<br/>

  The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/>

  So that near by the eye could not endure him,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01755">But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/>

  With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/>

  So that the water swallowed naught thereof.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01756">Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br/>

  Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br/>

  And more than a hundred spirits sat within.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01757">"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!"<br/>

  They chanted all together in one voice,<br/>

  With whatso in that psalm is after written.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01758">Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br/>

  Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br/>

  And he departed swiftly as he came.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01759">The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br/>

  Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br/>

  As one who in new matters makes essay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01760">On every side was darting forth the day.<br/>

  The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br/>

  From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01761">When the new people lifted up their faces<br/>

  Towards us, saying to us: "If ye know,<br/>

  Show us the way to go unto the mountain."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01762">And answer made Virgilius: "Ye believe<br/>

  Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br/>

  But we are strangers even as yourselves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01763">Just now we came, a little while before you,<br/>

  Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br/>

  That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01764">The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br/>

  Become aware that I was still alive,<br/>

  Pallid in their astonishment became;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01765">And as to messenger who bears the olive<br/>

  The people throng to listen to the news,<br/>

  And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01766">So at the sight of me stood motionless<br/>

  Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br/>

  Oblivious to go and make them fair.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01767">One from among them saw I coming forward,<br/>

  As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br/>

  That it incited me to do the like.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01768">O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br/>

  Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br/>

  As oft returned with them to my own breast!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01769">I think with wonder I depicted me;<br/>

  Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br/>

  And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01770">Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br/>

  Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br/>

  That it would stop awhile to speak with me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01771">It made reply to me: "Even as I loved thee<br/>

  In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br/>

  Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01772">"My own Casella! to return once more<br/>

  There where I am, I make this journey," said I;<br/>

  "But how from thee has so much time be taken?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01773">And he to me: "No outrage has been done me,<br/>

  If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br/>

  Has many times denied to me this passage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01774">For of a righteous will his own is made.<br/>

  He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br/>

  Whoever wished to enter with all peace;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01775">Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br/>

  Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br/>

  Benignantly by him have been received.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01776">Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br/>

  Because for evermore assemble there<br/>

  Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01777">And I: "If some new law take not from thee<br/>

  Memory or practice of the song of love,<br/>

  Which used to quiet in me all my longings,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01778">Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br/>

  Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br/>

  Hitherward coming is so much distressed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01779">"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,"<br/>

  Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br/>

  The melody within me still is sounding.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01780">My Master, and myself, and all that people<br/>

  Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br/>

  As if naught else might touch the mind of any.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01781">We all of us were moveless and attentive<br/>

  Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br/>

  Exclaiming: "What is this, ye laggard spirits?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01782">What negligence, what standing still is this?<br/>

  Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br/>

  That lets not God be manifest to you."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01783">Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br/>

  The doves, together at their pasture met,<br/>

  Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01784">If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br/>

  Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br/>

  Because they are assailed by greater care;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01785">So that fresh company did I behold<br/>

  The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,<br/>

  As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01786">Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>
<p id="id01787" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto III</p>
<p id="id01788" style="margin-top: 2em">Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br/>

  Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,<br/>

  Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01789">I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br/>

  And how without him had I kept my course?<br/>

  Who would have led me up along the mountain?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01790">He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br/>

  O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br/>

  How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01791">After his feet had laid aside the haste<br/>

  Which mars the dignity of every act,<br/>

  My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01792">Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br/>

  And I my sight directed to the hill<br/>

  That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01793">The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br/>

  Was broken in front of me into the figure<br/>

  Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01794">Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br/>

  Of being left alone, when I beheld<br/>

  Only in front of me the ground obscured.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01795">"Why dost thou still mistrust?" my Comforter<br/>

  Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br/>

  "Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01796">'Tis evening there already where is buried<br/>

  The body within which I cast a shadow;<br/>

  'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01797">Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br/>

  Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br/>

  Because one ray impedeth not another<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01798">To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br/>

  Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br/>

  That how it works be not unveiled to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01799">Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br/>

  Can traverse the illimitable way,<br/>

  Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01800">Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'<br/>

  For if ye had been able to see all,<br/>

  No need there were for Mary to give birth;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01801">And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br/>

  Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br/>

  Which evermore is given them for a grief.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01802">I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br/>

  And many others;"—and here bowed his head,<br/>

  And more he said not, and remained disturbed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01803">We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;<br/>

  There so precipitate we found the rock,<br/>

  That nimble legs would there have been in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01804">'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br/>

  The most secluded pathway is a stair<br/>

  Easy and open, if compared with that.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01805">"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br/>

  Slopes down," my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br/>

  "So that who goeth without wings may mount?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01806">And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br/>

  Examining the nature of the path,<br/>

  And I was looking up around the rock,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01807">On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br/>

  Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br/>

  And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01808">"Lift up thine eyes," I to the Master said;<br/>

  "Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br/>

  If thou of thine own self can have it not."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01809">Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br/>

  Replied: "Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br/>

  And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01810">Still was that people as far off from us,<br/>

  After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br/>

  As a good thrower with his hand would reach,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01811">When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br/>

  Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br/>

  As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01812">"O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!"<br/>

  Virgilius made beginning, "by that peace<br/>

  Which I believe is waiting for you all,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01813">Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br/>

  So that the going up be possible,<br/>

  For to lose time irks him most who most knows."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01814">As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br/>

  By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br/>

  Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01815">And what the foremost does the others do,<br/>

  Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br/>

  Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01816">So moving to approach us thereupon<br/>

  I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br/>

  Modest in face and dignified in gait.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01817">As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br/>

  The light upon the ground at my right side,<br/>

  So that from me the shadow reached the rock,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01818">They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br/>

  And all the others, who came after them,<br/>

  Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01819">"Without your asking, I confess to you<br/>

  This is a human body which you see,<br/>

  Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01820">Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br/>

  That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br/>

  Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01821">The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br/>

  "Return ye then, and enter in before us,"<br/>

  Making a signal with the back o' the hand<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01822">And one of them began: "Whoe'er thou art,<br/>

  Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br/>

  If e'er thou saw me in the other world."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01823">I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;<br/>

  Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br/>

  But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.<br/>

<p id="id01863">"Truly, my Master," said I, "never yet<br/>

<p id="id01864">That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01866">But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br/>

  How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br/>

  Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01867">And he to me: "This mount is such, that ever<br/>

<p id="id01868">Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br/>

  That going up shall be to thee as easy<br/>

  As going down the current in a boat,<br/>

  A voice close by us sounded: "Peradventure<br/>

  Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01871">At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br/>

  And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br/>

  Which neither I nor he before had noticed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01872">Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br/>

  Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br/>

  As one through indolence is wont to stand.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01873">And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br/>

  Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br/>

  Holding his face low down between them bowed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01874">"O my sweet Lord," I said, "do turn thine eye<br/>

  On him who shows himself more negligent<br/>

  Then even Sloth herself his sister were."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01875">Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br/>

  Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br/>

  And said: "Now go thou up, for thou art valiant."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01876">Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br/>

  That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br/>

  My going to him hindered not; and after<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01877">I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br/>

  Saying: "Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br/>

  O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01878">His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/>

  A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br/>

  Then I began: "Belacqua, I grieve not<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01879">For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br/>

  In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?<br/>

  Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01880">And he: "O brother, what's the use of climbing?<br/>

  Since to my torment would not let me go<br/>

  The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01881">First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br/>

  Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01889">"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,"<br/>

  The Master said, "that thou thy pace dost slacken?<br/>

  What matters it to thee what here is whispered?<br/>

<p id="id01892">What could I say in answer but "I come"?<br/>

  Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01893">Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br/>

  Came people in advance of us a little,<br/>

  Singing the Miserere verse by verse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01894">When they became aware I gave no place<br/>

  For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br/>

  They changed their song into a long, hoarse "Oh!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01895">And two of them, in form of messengers,<br/>

  Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br/>

  "Of your condition make us cognisant."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01896">And said my Master: "Ye can go your way<br/>

<p id="id01899">But upward they returned in briefer time,<br/>

  And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br/>

  Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.<br/>

<p id="id01900">"This folk that presses unto us is great,<br/>

  Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01903">Long since we all were slain by violence,<br/>

  And sinners even to the latest hour;<br/>

  Then did a light from heaven admonish us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01904">So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br/>

  From life we issued reconciled to God,<br/>

<p id="id01905">And I: "Although I gaze into your faces,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01907">And one began: "Each one has confidence<br/>

<p id="id01912">But if towards the Mira I had fled,<br/>

  When I was overtaken at Oriaco,<br/>

  I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01913">I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br/>

  Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br/>

  A lake made from my veins upon the ground."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01914">Then said another: "Ah, be that desire<br/>

<p id="id01917">"Oh," he replied, "at Casentino's foot<br/>

  Above the Hermitage in Apennine.<br/>

<p id="id01918">There where the name thereof becometh void<br/>

  Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br/>

  Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id01919">There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br/>

  Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br/>

</p>
<p id="id01920">Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02094">Only my Comforter was at my side,<br/>

  And now the sun was more than two hours high,<br/>

  And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02095">"Be not intimidated," said my Lord,<br/>

  "Be reassured, for all is well with us;<br/>

  Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02096">Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;<br/>

  See there the cliff that closes it around;<br/>

  See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02097">Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,<br/>

  When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<br/>

  Upon the flowers that deck the land below,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02098">There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;<br/>

  Let me take this one up, who is asleep;<br/>

  So will I make his journey easier for him.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02099">Sordello and the other noble shapes<br/>

  Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,<br/>

  Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02100">She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes<br/>

  That open entrance pointed out to me;<br/>

  Then she and sleep together went away."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02101">In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,<br/>

  And who to confidence his fear doth change,<br/>

  After the truth has been discovered to him,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02102">So did I change; and when without disquiet<br/>

  My Leader saw me, up along the cliff<br/>

  He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02103">Reader, thou seest well how I exalt<br/>

  My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br/>

  I fortify it, marvel not thereat.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02104">Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br/>

  That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br/>

  Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02105">I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br/>

  Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br/>

  And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02106">And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br/>

  I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br/>

  Such in the face that I endured it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02107">And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br/>

  Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,<br/>

  That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02108">"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?"<br/>

  Began he to exclaim; "where is the escort?<br/>

  Take heed your coming hither harm you not!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02109">"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,"<br/>

  My Master answered him, "but even now<br/>

  Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02110">"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,"<br/>

  Again began the courteous janitor;<br/>

  "Come forward then unto these stairs of ours."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02111">Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br/>

  Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br/>

  I mirrored myself therein as I appear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02112">The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br/>

  Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br/>

  Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02113">The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br/>

  Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br/>

  As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02114">Both of his feet was holding upon this<br/>

  The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br/>

  Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02115">Along the three stairs upward with good will<br/>

  Did my Conductor draw me, saying: "Ask<br/>

  Humbly that he the fastening may undo."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02116">Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br/>

  For mercy's sake besought that he would open,<br/>

  But first upon my breast three times I smote.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02117">Seven P's upon my forehead he described<br/>

  With the sword's point, and, "Take heed that thou wash<br/>

  These wounds, when thou shalt be within," he said.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02118">Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br/>

  Of the same colour were with his attire,<br/>

  And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02119">One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br/>

  First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br/>

  Plied he the door, so that I was content.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02120">"Whenever faileth either of these keys<br/>

  So that it turn not rightly in the lock,"<br/>

  He said to us, "this entrance doth not open.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02121">More precious one is, but the other needs<br/>

  More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br/>

  For it is that which doth the knot unloose.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02122">From Peter I have them; and he bade me err<br/>

  Rather in opening than in keeping shut,<br/>

  If people but fall down before my feet."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02123">Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,<br/>

  Exclaiming: "Enter; but I give you warning<br/>

  That forth returns whoever looks behind."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02124">And when upon their hinges were turned round<br/>

  The swivels of that consecrated gate,<br/>

  Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02125">Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<br/>

  Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good<br/>

  Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02126">At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br/>

  And "Te Deum laudamus" seemed to hear<br/>

  In voices mingled with sweet melody.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02127">Exactly such an image rendered me<br/>

  That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br/>

  When people singing with the organ stand;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02128">For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</p>
<p id="id02129" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto X</p>
<p id="id02130" style="margin-top: 2em">When we had crossed the threshold of the door<br/>

  Which the perverted love of souls disuses,<br/>

  And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,<br/>

  What for my failing had been fit excuse?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02132">We mounted upward through a rifted rock,<br/>

<p id="id02134">And this our footsteps so infrequent made,<br/>

  There where the mountain backward piles itself,<br/>

<p id="id02136">I wearied out, and both of us uncertain<br/>

  About our way, we stopped upon a plain<br/>

<p id="id02138">And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,<br/>

  Now on the left, and on the right flank now,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02139">Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,<br/>

  There sculptured in a gracious attitude,<br/>

  He did not seem an image that is silent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02143">One would have sworn that he was saying, "Ave;"<br/>

  For she was there in effigy portrayed<br/>

  Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,<br/>

<p id="id02144">And in her mien this language had impressed,<br/>

<p id="id02150">Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,<br/>

<p id="id02223">And there to draw his friend from the duress<br/>

<p id="id02227" style="margin-top: 2em">Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,<br/>

  I with that heavy-laden soul went on,<br/>

  As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02228">But when he said, "Leave him, and onward pass,<br/>

  For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02229">Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed<br/>

  My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts<br/>

  Remained within me downcast and abashed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02230">I had moved on, and followed willingly<br/>

  The footsteps of my Master, and we both<br/>

  Already showed how light of foot we were,<br/>

  In point of artifice, with figures covered<br/>

  Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.<br/>

<p id="id02235">I saw that one who was created noble<br/>

  More than all other creatures, down from heaven<br/>

<p id="id02243">Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement<br/>

  How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon<br/>

  Costly appear the luckless ornament;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02244">Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves<br/>

  Upon Sennacherib within the temple,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02245">Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage<br/>

  That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<br/>

  "Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02246">Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02251">More of the mount by us was now encompassed,<br/>

  And far more spent the circuit of the sun,<br/>

  Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02252">When he, who ever watchful in advance<br/>

  Was going on, began: "Lift up thy head,<br/>

  'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02253">Lo there an Angel who is making haste<br/>

  To come towards us; lo, returning is<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02255">I was familiar with his admonition<br/>

  Ever to lose no time; so on this theme<br/>

  He could not unto me speak covertly.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02256">Towards us came the being beautiful<br/>

  Vested in white, and in his countenance<br/>

  Such as appears the tremulous morning star.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02257">His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;<br/>

  "Come," said he, "near at hand here are the steps,<br/>

  And easy from henceforth is the ascent."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02258">At this announcement few are they who come!<br/>

  O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br/>

  Why fall ye thus before a little wind?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02259">He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/>

  There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/>

  Then a safe passage promised unto me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02260">As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/>

  Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/>

  O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02261">The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/>

  By stairways that were made there in the age<br/>

  When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02262">E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/>

  Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/>

  But on this, side and that the high rock graze.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02263">As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/>

  "Beati pauperes spiritu," voices<br/>

  Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02264">Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/>

  From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/>

  One enters, and below with wild laments.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02265">We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/>

  And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/>

  Than on the plain it had appeared before.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02266">Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/>

  Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/>

  Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02267">He answered: "When the P's which have remained<br/>

  Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/>

  Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02268">Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/>

  That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/>

  But urging up will be to them delight."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02269">Then did I even as they do who are going<br/>

  With something on the head to them unknown,<br/>

  Unless the signs of others make them doubt,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02270">Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/>

  And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/>

  Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02271">And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/>

  I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/>

  Upon my temples he who bore the keys;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02272">Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>
<p id="id02273" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
<p id="id02274" style="margin-top: 2em">We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/>

  Where for the second time is cut away<br/>

  The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02275">There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/>

  The hill all round about, as does the first,<br/>

  Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02276">Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br/>

  So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br/>

  With but the livid colour of the stone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02277">"If to inquire we wait for people here,"<br/>

  The Poet said, "I fear that peradventure<br/>

  Too much delay will our election have."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02278">Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/>

  Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/>

  And turned the left part of himself about.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02279">"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/>

  Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"<br/>

  Said he, "as one within here should be led.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02280">Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/>

  If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/>

  Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02281">As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/>

  So much already there had we advanced<br/>

  In little time, by dint of ready will;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02282">And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/>

  They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/>

  Unto Love's table courteous invitations,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02283">The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/>

  "Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,<br/>

  And went reiterating it behind us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02284">And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/>

  Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/>

  "I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02285">"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"<br/>

  And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/>

  Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02286">And the good Master said: "This circle scourges<br/>

  The sin of envy, and on that account<br/>

  Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02287">The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/>

  I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/>

  Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02288">But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/>

  And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/>

  And each one close against the cliff is seated."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02289">Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/>

  I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/>

  Not from the colour of the stone diverse.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02290">And when we were a little farther onward,<br/>

  I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"<br/>

  A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02291">I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/>

  A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/>

  With pity at what afterward I saw.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02292">For when I had approached so near to them<br/>

  That manifest to me their acts became,<br/>

  Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02293">Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/>

  And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/>

  And all of them were by the bank sustained.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02294">Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/>

  Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/>

  And one upon another leans his head,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02295">So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/>

  Not only at the accent of their words,<br/>

  But at their aspect, which no less implores.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02296">And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/>

  So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/>

  Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02297">For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/>

  And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/>

  Is done, because it will not quiet stay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02298">To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/>

  Seeing the others without being seen;<br/>

  Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02299">Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/>

  And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/>

  But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02300">I had Virgilius upon that side<br/>

  Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/>

  Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02301">Upon the other side of me I had<br/>

  The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/>

  Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02302">To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"<br/>

  Began I, "of beholding the high light,<br/>

  Which your desire has solely in its care,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02303">So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br/>

  Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br/>

  Through them descend the river of the mind,<br/>

<p id="id02304">Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,<br/>

  If any soul among you here is Latian,<br/>

  And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02305">"O brother mine, each one is citizen<br/>

  Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br/>

  Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02306">By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/>

  A little farther on than where I stood,<br/>

  Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02307">Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/>

  In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/>

  Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02308">"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,<br/>

  If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/>

  Make thyself known to me by place or name."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02309">"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with<br/>

  The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/>

  Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02310">Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/>

  Was called, and I was at another's harm<br/>

  More happy far than at my own good fortune.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02311">And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br/>

  Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br/>

  The arc already of my years descending,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02312">My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/>

  Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br/>

  And I was praying God for what he willed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02313">Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br/>

  Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/>

  A joy received unequalled by all others;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02314">So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/>

  Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'<br/>

  As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02315">Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/>

  Of my existence, and as yet would not<br/>

  My debt have been by penitence discharged,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02316">Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br/>

  Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br/>

  Who out of charity was grieved for me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02317">But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/>

  Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/>

  As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02318">"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,<br/>

  But for short space; for small is the offence<br/>

  Committed by their being turned with envy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02319">Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/>

  My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/>

  For even now the load down there weighs on me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02320">And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us<br/>

  Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"<br/>

  And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02321">And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/>

  Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/>

  O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02322">"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"<br/>

  She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/>

  Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02323">And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/>

  If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/>

  Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02324">Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/>

  Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br/>

  More hope than in discovering the Diana;<br/>

  Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br/>

  And gently, so that he may speak, accost him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02329">Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,<br/>

  Discourse about me there on the right hand;<br/>

  Then held supine their faces to address me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02330">And said the one: "O soul, that, fastened still<br/>

<p id="id02378" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XV</p>
<p id="id02379" style="margin-top: 2em">As much as 'twixt the close of the third hour<br/>

  And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02380">So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br/>

  Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br/>

  There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02381">And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br/>

  Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br/>

  That straight towards the west we now were going<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02382">When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br/>

  Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br/>

  And stupor were to me the things unknown,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02383">Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br/>

  I raised my hands, and made myself the visor<br/>

<p id="id02384">As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br/>

  The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,<br/>

<p id="id02385">That it descends, and deviates as far<br/>

  (As demonstrate experiment and art,)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02386">So it appeared to me that by a light<br/>

  Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br/>

  On which account my sight was swift to flee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02387">"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br/>

  So fully screen my sight that it avail me,"<br/>

  Said I, "and seems towards us to be moving?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02388">"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet<br/>

  "An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02389">Soon will it be, that to behold these things<br/>

  Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee<br/>

  As much as nature fashioned thee to feel."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02390">When we had reached the Angel benedight,<br/>

  With joyful voice he said: "Here enter in<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02391">We mounting were, already thence departed,<br/>

  And "Beati misericordes" was<br/>

  Behind us sung, "Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02392">My Master and myself, we two alone<br/>

  Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br/>

  Some profit to acquire from words of his;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02393">And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br/>

  "What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br/>

  Mentioning interdict and partnership?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02394">Whence he to me: "Of his own greatest failing<br/>

  He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not<br/>

  If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02395">Because are thither pointed your desires<br/>

  Where by companionship each share is lessened,<br/>

  Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02396">But if the love of the supernal sphere<br/>

  Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br/>

  There would not be that fear within your breast;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02397">For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'<br/>

  So much the more of good each one possesses,<br/>

  And more of charity in that cloister burns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02398">"I am more hungering to be satisfied,"<br/>

  I said, "than if I had before been silent,<br/>

  And more of doubt within my mind I gather.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02399">How can it be, that boon distributed<br/>

  The more possessors can more wealthy make<br/>

  Therein, than if by few it be possessed?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02400">And he to me: "Because thou fixest still<br/>

  Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/>

  Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02401">That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/>

  Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/>

  As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02402">So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/>

  So that as far as charity extends,<br/>

  O'er it increases the eternal valour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02403">And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/>

  More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/>

  And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02404">And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/>

  Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/>

  Take from thee this and every other longing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02405">Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<br/>

  As are the two already, the five wounds<br/>

  That close themselves again by being painful."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02406">Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"<br/>

  I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/>

  So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02407">There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/>

  Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/>

  And in a temple many persons saw;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02408">And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br/>

  Behaviour of a mother, saying: "Son,<br/>

  Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02409">Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/>

  Were seeking for thee;"—and as here she ceased,<br/>

  That which appeared at first had disappeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02410">Then I beheld another with those waters<br/>

  Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/>

  From great disdain of others it is born,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02411">And saying: "If of that city thou art lord,<br/>

  For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br/>

  And whence doth every science scintillate,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02412">Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/>

  That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"<br/>

  And the lord seemed to me benign and mild<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02413">To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/>

  "What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/>

  If he who loves us be by us condemned?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02414">Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/>

  With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/>

  Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02415">And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/>

  That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/>

  But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02416">Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/>

  That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/>

  With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02417">Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/>

  To things external to it which are true,<br/>

  Did I my not false errors recognize.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02418">My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/>

  Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/>

  Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02419">But hast been coming more than half a league<br/>

  Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/>

  In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02420">"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/>

  I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,<br/>

  When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02421">And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/>

  Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br/>

  Thy cogitations, howsoever small.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02422">What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/>

  To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/>

  Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02423">I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does<br/>

  Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br/>

  When of the soul bereft the body lies,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02424">But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/>

  Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/>

  To use their wakefulness when it returns."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02425">We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/>

  Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/>

  Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02426">And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/>

  In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/>

  Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02427">This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>
<p id="id02428" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XVI</p>
<p id="id02429" style="margin-top: 2em">Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02430">Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br/>

  As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br/>

  Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02431">For not an eye it suffered to stay open;<br/>

  Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,<br/>

  Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.<br/>

<p id="id02432">E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,<br/>

  Lest he should wander, or should strike against<br/>

  Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,<br/>

<p id="id02433">So went I through the bitter and foul air,<br/>

  Listening unto my Leader, who said only,<br/>

  "Look that from me thou be not separated."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02434">Voices I heard, and every one appeared<br/>

  To supplicate for peace and misericord<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02435">Still "Agnus Dei" their exordium was;<br/>

  One word there was in all, and metre one,<br/>

  So that all harmony appeared among them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02436">"Master," I said, "are spirits those I hear?"<br/>

  And he to me: "Thou apprehendest truly,<br/>

  And they the knot of anger go unloosing."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02437">"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/>

  And art discoursing of us even as though<br/>

  Thou didst by calends still divide the time?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02438">After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br/>

  Whereon my Master said: "Do thou reply,<br/>

  And ask if on this side the way go upward."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02439">And I: "O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br/>

  To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br/>

  Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02440">"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"<br/>

  He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/>

  Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02441">Thereon began I: "With that swathing band<br/>

  Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/>

  And hither came I through the infernal anguish.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02442">And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/>

  So that he wills that I behold his court<br/>

  By method wholly out of modern usage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02443">Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/>

  But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br/>

  Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02444">"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br/>

  At which has each one now unbent his bow.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02445">For mounting upward, thou art going right."<br/>

  Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee<br/>

  To pray for me when thou shalt be above."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02446">And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee<br/>

  To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br/>

  Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02447">First it was simple, and is now made double<br/>

  By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br/>

  Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02448">The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br/>

  By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br/>

  And with iniquity is big and covered;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02449">But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br/>

  That I may see it, and to others show it;<br/>

  For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02450">A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br/>

  He first sent forth, and then began he: "Brother,<br/>

  The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02451">Ye who are living every cause refer<br/>

  Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/>

  They of necessity moved with themselves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02452">If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/>

  Free will, nor any justice would there be<br/>

  In having joy for good, or grief for evil.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02453">The heavens your movements do initiate,<br/>

  I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br/>

  Light has been given you for good and evil,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02454">And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br/>

  In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/>

  Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02455">To greater force and to a better nature,<br/>

  Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/>

  The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02456">Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/>

  In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/>

  And I therein will now be thy true spy.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02457">Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br/>

  Before it is, like to a little girl<br/>

  Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02459">Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/>

  Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/>

  If guide or rein turn not aside its love.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02460">Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/>

  Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/>

  Of the true city should discern the tower.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02461">The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/>

  No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/>

  Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02462">Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/>

  Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br/>

  Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02463">Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br/>

  The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br/>

  That by main force one with the other go,<br/>

<p id="id02466">Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br/>

  In reprobation of the barbarous age?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02474">"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,"<br/>

  Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br/>

  In which the water it was made of fails,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02490">There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br/>

  Bitterly weeping, and she said: "O queen,<br/>

  Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02491">Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br/>

  Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br/>

  Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02492">As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br/>

  New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br/>

  And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02493">So this imagining of mine fell down<br/>

  As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br/>

  Greater by far than what is in our wont.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02494">I turned me round to see where I might be,<br/>

  When said a voice, "Here is the passage up;"<br/>

  Which from all other purposes removed me,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02495">And made my wish so full of eagerness<br/>

  To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br/>

  It never rests till meeting face to face;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02496">But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br/>

  And in its own excess its figure veils,<br/>

  Even so my power was insufficient here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02497">"This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br/>

  Of going up directs us without asking,<br/>

  And who with his own light himself conceals.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02498">He does with us as man doth with himself;<br/>

  For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br/>

  Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02499">Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br/>

  Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br/>

  For then we could not till the day return."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02500">Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br/>

  Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br/>

  And I, as soon as the first step I reached,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02501">Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br/>

  And fanning in the face, and saying, "'Beati<br/>

  Pacifici,' who are without ill anger."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02502">Already over us were so uplifted<br/>

  The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br/>

  That upon many sides the stars appeared.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02503">"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?"<br/>

  I said within myself; for I perceived<br/>

  The vigour of my legs was put in truce.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02504">We at the point were where no more ascends<br/>

  The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br/>

  Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02505">And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br/>

  Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br/>

  Then to my Master turned me round and said:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02506">"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br/>

  Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br/>

  Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02507">And he to me: "The love of good, remiss<br/>

  In what it should have done, is here restored;<br/>

  Here plied again the ill-belated oar;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02508">But still more openly to understand,<br/>

  Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/>

  Some profitable fruit from our delay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02509">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/>

  Son," he began, "was destitute of love<br/>

  Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02510">The natural was ever without error;<br/>

  But err the other may by evil object,<br/>

  Or by too much, or by too little vigour.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02511">While in the first it well directed is,<br/>

  And in the second moderates itself,<br/>

  It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02512">But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/>

  Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/>

  'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02513">Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/>

  The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br/>

  And every act that merits punishment.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02514">Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/>

  Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/>

  From their own hatred all things are secure;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02515">And since we cannot think of any being<br/>

  Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/>

  Of hating Him is all desire cut off.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02516">Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/>

  The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,<br/>

  And this is born in three modes in your clay.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02517">There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br/>

  Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br/>

  That from his greatness he may be cast down;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02518">There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br/>

  Fear they may lose because another rises,<br/>

  Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02519">And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br/>

  So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br/>

  And such must needs shape out another's harm.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02520">This threefold love is wept for down below;<br/>

  Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br/>

  That runneth after good with measure faulty.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02521">Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/>

  Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/>

  Therefore to overtake it each one strives.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02522">If languid love to look on this attract you,<br/>

  Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br/>

  After just penitence, torments you for it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02523">There's other good that does not make man happy;<br/>

  'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good<br/>

  Essence, of every good the fruit and root.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02524">The love that yields itself too much to this<br/>

  Above us is lamented in three circles;<br/>

  But how tripartite it may be described,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02525">I say not, that thou seek it for thyself."</p>

  An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br/>

  So that it makes the soul turn unto it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02535">And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br/>

  Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br/>

  Which is by pleasure bound in you anew<br/>

<p id="id02757">Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering<br/>

  That hid from me whatever good I speak of,<br/>

  While in ascending we have time to spare,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02758">Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<br/>

  Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;<br/>

  Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02759">"These, Persius and myself, and others many,"<br/>

  Replied my Leader, "with that Grecian are<br/>

  Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02760">In the first circle of the prison blind;<br/>

  Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse<br/>

  Which has our nurses ever with itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02761">Euripides is with us, Antiphon,<br/>

  Simonides, Agatho, and many other<br/>

  Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02762">There some of thine own people may be seen,<br/>

  Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,<br/>

  And there Ismene mournful as of old.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02763">There she is seen who pointed out Langia;<br/>

  There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis,<br/>

  And there Deidamia with her sisters."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02764">Silent already were the poets both,<br/>

  Attent once more in looking round about,<br/>

  From the ascent and from the walls released;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02765">And four handmaidens of the day already<br/>

  Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth<br/>

  Was pointing upward still its burning horn,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02766">What time my Guide: "I think that tow'rds the edge<br/>

  Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,<br/>

  Circling the mount as we are wont to do."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02767">Thus in that region custom was our ensign;<br/>

  And we resumed our way with less suspicion<br/>

  For the assenting of that worthy soul<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02768">They in advance went on, and I alone<br/>

  Behind them, and I listened to their speech,<br/>

  Which gave me lessons in the art of song.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02769">But soon their sweet discourses interrupted<br/>

  A tree which midway in the road we found,<br/>

  With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02770">And even as a fir-tree tapers upward<br/>

  From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;<br/>

  I think in order that no one might climb it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02771">On that side where our pathway was enclosed<br/>

  Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,<br/>

  And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02772">The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,<br/>

  And from among the foliage a voice<br/>

  Cried: "Of this food ye shall have scarcity."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02773">Then said: "More thoughtful Mary was of making<br/>

  The marriage feast complete and honourable,<br/>

  Than of her mouth which now for you responds;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02774">And for their drink the ancient Roman women<br/>

  With water were content; and Daniel<br/>

  Disparaged food, and understanding won.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02775">The primal age was beautiful as gold;<br/>

  Acorns it made with hunger savorous,<br/>

  And nectar every rivulet with thirst.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02776">Honey and locusts were the aliments<br/>

  That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;<br/>

  Whence he is glorious, and so magnified<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02777">As by the Evangel is revealed to you."</p>

<p id="id02779" style="margin-top: 2em">The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes<br/>

  I riveted, as he is wont to do<br/>

  Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02780">My more than Father said unto me: "Son,<br/>

  Come now; because the time that is ordained us<br/>

  More usefully should be apportioned out."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02781">I turned my face and no less soon my steps<br/>

  Unto the Sages, who were speaking so<br/>

  They made the going of no cost to me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02782">And lo! were heard a song and a lament,<br/>

  "Labia mea, Domine," in fashion<br/>

  Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02783">"O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?"<br/>

  Began I; and he answered: "Shades that go<br/>

  Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02784">In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,<br/>

  Who, unknown people on the road o'ertaking,<br/>

  Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02785">Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion<br/>

  Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us<br/>

  A crowd of spirits silent and devout.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02786">Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br/>

  Pallid in face, and so emaciate<br/>

  That from the bones the skin did shape itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02787">I do not think that so to merest rind<br/>

  Could Erisichthon have been withered up<br/>

  By famine, when most fear he had of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02788">Thinking within myself I said: "Behold,<br/>

  This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,<br/>

  When Mary made a prey of her own son."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02789">Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<br/>

  Whoever in the face of men reads 'omo'<br/>

  Might well in these have recognised the 'm.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02790">Who would believe the odour of an apple,<br/>

  Begetting longing, could consume them so,<br/>

  And that of water, without knowing how?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02791">I still was wondering what so famished them,<br/>

  For the occasion not yet manifest<br/>

  Of their emaciation and sad squalor;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02792">And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br/>

  His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br/>

  Then cried aloud: "What grace to me is this?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02793">Never should I have known him by his look;<br/>

  But in his voice was evident to me<br/>

  That which his aspect had suppressed within it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02794">This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br/>

  My recognition of his altered face,<br/>

  And I recalled the features of Forese.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02795">"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,"<br/>

  Entreated he, "which doth my skin discolour,<br/>

  Nor at default of flesh that I may have;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02796">But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br/>

  Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br/>

  Do not delay in speaking unto me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02797">"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br/>

  Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,"<br/>

  I answered him, "beholding it so changed!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02798">But tell me, for God's sake, what thus denudes you?<br/>

  Make me not speak while I am marvelling,<br/>

  For ill speaks he who's full of other longings."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02799">And he to me: "From the eternal council<br/>

  Falls power into the water and the tree<br/>

  Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02800">All of this people who lamenting sing,<br/>

  For following beyond measure appetite<br/>

  In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02801">Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us<br/>

  The scent that issues from the apple-tree,<br/>

  And from the spray that sprinkles o'er the verdure;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02802">And not a single time alone, this ground<br/>

  Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,—<br/>

  I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02803">For the same wish doth lead us to the tree<br/>

  Which led the Christ rejoicing to say 'Eli,'<br/>

  When with his veins he liberated us."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02804">And I to him: "Forese, from that day<br/>

  When for a better life thou changedst worlds,<br/>

  Up to this time five years have not rolled round.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02805">If sooner were the power exhausted in thee<br/>

  Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised<br/>

  Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02806">How hast thou come up hitherward already?<br/>

  I thought to find thee down there underneath,<br/>

  Where time for time doth restitution make."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02807">And he to me: "Thus speedily has led me<br/>

  To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,<br/>

  My Nella with her overflowing tears;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02808">She with her prayers devout and with her sighs<br/>

  Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,<br/>

  And from the other circles set me free.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02809">So much more dear and pleasing is to God<br/>

  My little widow, whom so much I loved,<br/>

  As in good works she is the more alone;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02810">For the Barbagia of Sardinia<br/>

  By far more modest in its women is<br/>

  Than the Barbagia I have left her in.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02811">O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?<br/>

  A future time is in my sight already,<br/>

  To which this hour will not be very old,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02812">When from the pulpit shall be interdicted<br/>

  To the unblushing womankind of Florence<br/>

  To go about displaying breast and paps.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02813">What savages were e'er, what Saracens,<br/>

  Who stood in need, to make them covered go,<br/>

  Of spiritual or other discipline?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02814">But if the shameless women were assured<br/>

  Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already<br/>

  Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02815">For if my foresight here deceive me not,<br/>

  They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks<br/>

  Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02816">O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;<br/>

  See that not only I, but all these people<br/>

  Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02817">Whence I to him: "If thou bring back to mind<br/>

  What thou with me hast been and I with thee,<br/>

  The present memory will be grievous still.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02818">Out of that life he turned me back who goes<br/>

  In front of me, two days agone when round<br/>

  The sister of him yonder showed herself,"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02819">And to the sun I pointed.  "Through the deep<br/>

  Night of the truly dead has this one led me,<br/>

  With this true flesh, that follows after him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02820">Thence his encouragements have led me up,<br/>

  Ascending and still circling round the mount<br/>

  That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02821">He says that he will bear me company,<br/>

  Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;<br/>

  There it behoves me to remain without him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02822">This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,"<br/>

  And him I pointed at; "the other is<br/>

  That shade for whom just now shook every slope<br/>

  From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed<br/>

  Wonder at me, aware that I was living.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02827">And I, continuing my colloquy,<br/>

  From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br/>

  Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02833">He named me many others one by one;<br/>

  And all contented seemed at being named,<br/>

  So that for this I saw not one dark look.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02834">I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br/>

  Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br/>

  Who with his crook had pastured many people.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02835">I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br/>

  Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br/>

  And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02836">But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br/>

  One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br/>

  Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02837">He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br/>

  From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br/>

  Of justice, that doth macerate them so.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02838">"O soul," I said, "that seemest so desirous<br/>

  To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br/>

  And with thy speech appease thyself and me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02839">"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,"<br/>

  Began he, "who to thee shall pleasant make<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02840">Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br/>

  If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br/>

  True things hereafter will declare it to thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02841">But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/>

  Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/>

  'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02842">And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever<br/>

  Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/>

  Which he within me dictates, singing go."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02843">"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot<br/>

  Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/>

  Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02844">I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/>

  Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/>

  Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02845">And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/>

  No difference sees from one style to another;"<br/>

  And as if satisfied, he held his peace.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02846">Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,<br/>

  Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/>

  Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02847">In such wise all the people who were there,<br/>

  Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/>

  Both by their leanness and their wishes light.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02848">And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/>

  Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/>

  Until he vents the panting of his chest;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02849">So did Forese let the holy flock<br/>

  Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/>

  "When will it be that I again shall see thee?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02850">"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;<br/>

  Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/>

  But I shall sooner in desire arrive;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02851">Because the place where I was set to live<br/>

  From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/>

  And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02852">"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it<br/>

  At a beast's tail behold I dragged along<br/>

  Towards the valley where is no repentance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02853">Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/>

  Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/>

  And leaves the body vilely mutilated.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02854">Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted<br/>

  His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee<br/>

  That which my speech no farther can declare.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02855">Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/>

  Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/>

  By coming onward thus abreast with thee."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02856">As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/>

  A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/>

  And seeks the honour of the first encounter,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02857">So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/>

  And on the road remained I with those two,<br/>

  Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02858">And when before us he had gone so far<br/>

  Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/>

  As was my understanding to his words,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02859">Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/>

  Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/>

  From having but just then turned thitherward.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02860">People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/>

  And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/>

  Like little children eager and deluded,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02861">Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/>

  But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/>

  Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02862">Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/>

  And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/>

  Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02863">"Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/>

  The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/>

  And out of that one has this tree been raised."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02864">Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/>

  Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/>

  Went crowding forward on the side that rises.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02865">"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones<br/>

  Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/>

  Combated Theseus with their double breasts;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02866">And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/>

  Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/>

  When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02867">Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/>

  On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/>

  Followed forsooth by miserable gains;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02868">Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/>

  A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/>

  In contemplation, each without a word.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02869">"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"<br/>

  Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/>

  As terrified and timid beasts are wont.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02870">I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/>

  And never in a furnace was there seen<br/>

  Metals or glass so lucent and so red<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02871">As one I saw who said: "If it may please you<br/>

  To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/>

  This way goes he who goeth after peace."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02872">His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/>

  So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/>

  Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02873">And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/>

  The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/>

  Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02874">So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/>

  My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/>

  That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02875">And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace<br/>

  So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/>

  Excites not in their breasts too great desire,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02876">Hungering at all times so far as is just."</p>
<p id="id02877" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXV</p>
<p id="id02878" style="margin-top: 2em">Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br/>

  Because the sun had his meridian circle<br/>

  To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02879">Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,<br/>

  But goes his way, whate'er to him appear,<br/>

  If of necessity the sting transfix him,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02880">In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br/>

  Taking the stairway, one before the other,<br/>

  Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02881">And as the little stork that lifts its wing<br/>

  With a desire to fly, and does not venture<br/>

  To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02882">Even such was I, with the desire of asking<br/>

  Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming<br/>

  He makes who doth address himself to speak.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02883">Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,<br/>

  My father sweet forbore, but said: "Let fly<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02884">With confidence I opened then my mouth,<br/>

  And I began: "How can one meagre grow<br/>

</p>
<p id="id02885">"If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<br/>

  Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,<br/>

  This would not," said he, "be to thee so sour;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id02886">And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion<br/>

  Trembles within a mirror your own image;<br/>

<p id="id03023">Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/>

<p id="id03027" style="margin-top: 2em">Eager already to search in and round<br/>

  The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,<br/>

  Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,<br/>

<p id="id03028">Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/>

  Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/>

  Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03029">A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/>

  Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br/>

  No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,<br/>

<p id="id03031">Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/>

  Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/>

  Could not perceive where I had entered it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03035">And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/>

  Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves<br/>

  Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br/>

  The great variety of the fresh may.<br/>

<p id="id03039">And there appeared to me (even as appears<br/>

  Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/>

  Through very wonder every other thought)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03040">A lady all alone, who went along<br/>

  Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/>

<p id="id03041">"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/>

  Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03042">May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/>

  Near to this river's bank," I said to her,<br/>

  "So much that I might hear what thou art singing.<br/>

<p id="id03043">Thou makest me remember where and what<br/>

  Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/>

  Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03044">As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/>

  And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/>

  And hardly puts one foot before the other,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03045">On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/>

  She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/>

  Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03046">And my entreaties made to be content,<br/>

  So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/>

  Came unto me together with its meaning<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03047">As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/>

  Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/>

  To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03048">I do not think there shone so great a light<br/>

  Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/>

  By her own son, beyond his usual custom!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03049">Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/>

  Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br/>

  Which that high land produces without seed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03050">Apart three paces did the river make us;<br/>

  But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br/>

<p id="id03051">More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br/>

  For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br/>

  Than that from me, because it oped not then.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03052">"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,"<br/>

  Began she, "peradventure, in this place<br/>

  Elect to human nature for its nest,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03053">Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/>

  But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light<br/>

  Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03054">And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br/>

  Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/>

  To all thy questionings, as far as needful."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03055">"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,<br/>

  In something which I heard opposed to this."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03056">Whence she: "I will relate how from its cause<br/>

<p id="id03058">By his default short while he sojourned here;<br/>

  By his default to weeping and to toil<br/>

  He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.<br/>

<p id="id03059">That the disturbance which below is made<br/>

  By exhalations of the land and water,<br/>

  (Which far as may be follow after heat,)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03060">Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br/>

<p id="id03061">Now since the universal atmosphere<br/>

  Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br/>

  Unless the circle is broken on some side,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03062">Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br/>

  In living ether, doth this motion strike<br/>

  And make the forest sound, for it is dense;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03063">And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br/>

  That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br/>

  And this, revolving, scatters it around;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03064">And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy<br/>

  In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br/>

  Of divers qualities the divers trees;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03065">It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br/>

  This being heard, whenever any plant<br/>

  Without seed manifest there taketh root.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03066">And thou must know, this holy table-land<br/>

  In which thou art is full of every seed,<br/>

  And fruit has in it never gathered there.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03067">The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br/>

  Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br/>

  Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03068">But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br/>

  Which by the will of God as much regains<br/>

  As it discharges, open on two sides.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03069">Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br/>

  Which takes away all memory of sin;<br/>

  On that, of every good deed done restores it.<br/>

<p id="id03070">Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br/>

  Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br/>

  If first on either side it be not tasted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03071">This every other savour doth transcend;<br/>

  And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br/>

  Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03072">I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br/>

  Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br/>

  If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03073">Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br/>

  The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br/>

  Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03074">Here was the human race in innocence;<br/>

  Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br/>

  This is the nectar of which each one speaks."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03075">Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br/>

  Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br/>

  They had been listening to these closing words;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03076">Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>
<p id="id03077" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</p>
<p id="id03078" style="margin-top: 2em">Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br/>

  She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br/>

  "Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03079">And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br/>

  Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/>

  One to avoid and one to see the sun,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03080">She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/>

  Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/>

  Her little steps with little steps attending.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03081">Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br/>

  When equally the margins gave a turn,<br/>

  In such a way, that to the East I faced.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03082">Nor even thus our way continued far<br/>

  Before the lady wholly turned herself<br/>

  Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03083">And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br/>

  On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br/>

  Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03084">But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br/>

  And that continuing brightened more and more,<br/>

  Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03085">And a delicious melody there ran<br/>

  Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br/>

  Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03086">For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/>

  The woman only, and but just created,<br/>

  Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03087">Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br/>

  I sooner should have tasted those delights<br/>

  Ineffable, and for a longer time.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03088">While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br/>

  Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br/>

  And still solicitous of more delights,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03089">In front of us like an enkindled fire<br/>

  Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br/>

  And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03090">O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br/>

  Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br/>

  The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03091">Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br/>

  And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br/>

  To put in verse things difficult to think.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03092">A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br/>

  In semblance the long space still intervening<br/>

  Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03093">But when I had approached so near to them<br/>

  The common object, which the sense deceives,<br/>

  Lost not by distance any of its marks,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03094">The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br/>

  Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br/>

  And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03095">Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br/>

  Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br/>

  Of midnight, at the middle of her month.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03096">I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br/>

  To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br/>

  With visage no less full of wonderment.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03097">Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br/>

  Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br/>

  They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03098">The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only<br/>

  So with affection for the living lights,<br/>

  And dost not look at what comes after them?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03099">Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br/>

  Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br/>

  And such a whiteness never was on earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03100">The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br/>

  And back to me reflected my left side,<br/>

  E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03101">When I upon my margin had such post<br/>

  That nothing but the stream divided us,<br/>

  Better to see I gave my steps repose;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03102">And I beheld the flamelets onward go,<br/>

  Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,<br/>

  And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03103">So that it overhead remained distinct<br/>

  With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br/>

  Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03104">These standards to the rearward longer were<br/>

  Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br/>

  Ten paces were the outermost apart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03105">Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br/>

  The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br/>

  Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03106">They all of them were singing: "Blessed thou<br/>

  Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed<br/>

  For evermore shall be thy loveliness."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03107">After the flowers and other tender grasses<br/>

  In front of me upon the other margin<br/>

  Were disencumbered of that race elect,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03108">Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br/>

  There came close after them four animals,<br/>

  Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03109">Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br/>

  The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus<br/>

  If they were living would be such as these.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03110">Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste<br/>

  My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,<br/>

  That I in this cannot be prodigal.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03111">But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<br/>

  As he beheld them from the region cold<br/>

  Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03112">And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,<br/>

  Such were they here; saving that in their plumage<br/>

  John is with me, and differeth from him.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03113">The interval between these four contained<br/>

  A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<br/>

  Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03114">And upward he extended both his wings<br/>

  Between the middle list and three and three,<br/>

  So that he injured none by cleaving it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03115">So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br/>

  His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,<br/>

  And white the others with vermilion mingled.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03116">Not only Rome with no such splendid car<br/>

  E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,<br/>

  But poor to it that of the Sun would be,—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03117">That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up<br/>

  At the importunate orison of Earth,<br/>

  When Jove was so mysteriously just.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03118">Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<br/>

  Came onward dancing; one so very red<br/>

  That in the fire she hardly had been noted.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03119">The second was as if her flesh and bones<br/>

  Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br/>

  The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03120">And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br/>

  Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/>

  The others took their step, or slow or swift.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03121">Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/>

  Vested in purple, following the measure<br/>

  Of one of them with three eyes m her head.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03122">In rear of all the group here treated of<br/>

  Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br/>

  But like in gait, each dignified and grave.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03123">One showed himself as one of the disciples<br/>

  Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature<br/>

  Made for the animals she holds most dear;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03124">Contrary care the other manifested,<br/>

  With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<br/>

  Terror to me on this side of the river.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03125">Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<br/>

  And behind all an aged man alone<br/>

  Walking in sleep with countenance acute.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03126">And like the foremost company these seven<br/>

  Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br/>

  No garland round about the head they wore,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03127">But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br/>

  At little distance would the sight have sworn<br/>

  That all were in a flame above their brows.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03128">And when the car was opposite to me<br/>

  Thunder was heard; and all that folk august<br/>

  Seemed to have further progress interdicted,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03129">There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p>

  So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter<br/>

  Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03158">Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/>

  Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"<br/>

  But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03159">Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/>

  Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes,<br/>

  So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;<br/>

<p id="id03161">E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,<br/>

  Before the song of those who sing for ever<br/>

  After the music of the eternal spheres.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03162">But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/>

  Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/>

  "O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03163">The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/>

  To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br/>

  Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03164">She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/>

  Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br/>

  Thus her discourse directed afterwards:<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03165">"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br/>

  So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br/>

  One step the ages make upon their path;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03166">Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br/>

  That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br/>

  So that the sin and dole be of one measure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03167">Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/>

  That destine every seed unto some end,<br/>

  According as the stars are in conjunction,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03168">But by the largess of celestial graces,<br/>

  Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/>

  That near to them our sight approaches not,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03169">Such had this man become in his new life<br/>

  Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/>

  Would have made admirable proof in him;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03170">But so much more malignant and more savage<br/>

  Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/>

  The more good earthly vigour it possesses.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03171">Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/>

  Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/>

  I led him with me turned in the right way.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03172">As soon as ever of my second age<br/>

  I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/>

  Himself from me he took and gave to others.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03173">When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br/>

  And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/>

  I was to him less dear and less delightful;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03174">And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/>

  Pursuing the false images of good,<br/>

  That never any promises fulfil;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03175">Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/>

  By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/>

  I called him back, so little did he heed them.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03176">So low he fell, that all appliances<br/>

  For his salvation were already short,<br/>

  Save showing him the people of perdition.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03177">For this I visited the gates of death,<br/>

  And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/>

  My intercessions were with weeping borne.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03178">God's lofty fiat would be violated,<br/>

  If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/>

  Should tasted be, withouten any scot<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03179">Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears."</p>
<p id="id03180" style="margin-top: 3em">Purgatorio: Canto XXXI</p>
<p id="id03181" style="margin-top: 2em">"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"<br/>

  Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/>

  That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03182">She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/>

  "Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/>

  Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03183">My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/>

  That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/>

  Than by its organs it was set at large.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03184">Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?<br/>

  Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/>

  In thee not yet are by the waters injured."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03185">Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/>

  Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/>

  Was needful to the understanding of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03186">Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged<br/>

  Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03187">So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/>

  Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/>

  And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03188">Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine<br/>

  Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/>

  Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03189">What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/>

  Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/>

  Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03190">And what allurements or what vantages<br/>

  Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/>

  That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03191">After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/>

  Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/>

  And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03192">Weeping I said: "The things that present were<br/>

  With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/>

  Soon as your countenance concealed itself."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03193">And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/>

  What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/>

  Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03194">But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/>

  The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/>

  Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03195">But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/>

  For thy transgression, and another time<br/>

  Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03196">Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/>

  So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/>

  My buried flesh should have directed thee.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03197">Never to thee presented art or nature<br/>

  Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/>

  I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03198">And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/>

  By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/>

  Should then have drawn thee into its desire?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03199">Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/>

  Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/>

  To follow me, who was no longer such.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03200">Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/>

  To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br/>

  Or other vanity of such brief use.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03201">The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/>

  But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/>

  In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03202">Even as children silent in their shame<br/>

  Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/>

  And conscious of their fault, and penitent;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03203">So was I standing; and she said: "If thou<br/>

  In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/>

  And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03204">With less resistance is a robust holm<br/>

  Uprooted, either by a native wind<br/>

  Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03205">Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br/>

  And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/>

  Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03206">And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/>

  Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/>

  Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03207">And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/>

  Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/>

  That is one person only in two natures.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03208">Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/>

  She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/>

  To excel, than others here, when she was here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03209">So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/>

  That of all other things the one which turned me<br/>

  Most to its love became the most my foe.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03210">Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/>

  O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03211">Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br/>

  The lady I had found alone, above me<br/>

  I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03212">Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br/>

  And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br/>

  Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03213">When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br/>

  "Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,<br/>

  Remember it I cannot, much less write it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03214">The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/>

  Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br/>

  Where I was forced to swallow of the water.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03215">Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/>

  Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/>

  And each one with her arm did cover me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03216">'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br/>

  Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br/>

  The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03218">Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/>

  Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,<br/>

  Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03219">"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes," they said;<br/>

  "Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br/>

  Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03220">A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/>

  Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br/>

  That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03221">As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br/>

  My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br/>

  It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03224">Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br/>

  In bearing, did the other three advance,<br/>

  Singing to their angelic saraband.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03225">"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,"<br/>

  Such was their song, "unto thy faithful one,<br/>

  Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps.<br/>

<p id="id03226">In grace do us the grace that thou unveil<br/>

  Thy face to him, so that he may discern<br/>

  Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus<br/>

  Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,<br/>

<p id="id03228">He would not seem to have his mind encumbered<br/>

  Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03232">And upon this side and on that they had<br/>

  Walls of indifference, so the holy smile<br/>

  Drew them unto itself with the old net<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03233">When forcibly my sight was turned away<br/>

  Towards my left hand by those goddesses,<br/>

  Because I heard from them a "Too intently!"<br/>

<p id="id03235">But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,<br/>

  I say the less in reference to the greater<br/>

<p id="id03239">Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,<br/>

  And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,<br/>

  But so that not a feather of him fluttered.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03240">The lady fair who drew me through the ford<br/>

  Followed with Statius and myself the wheel<br/>

<p id="id03243">I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!"<br/>

  Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br/>

  Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03244">Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br/>

  The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br/>

  "Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03247">And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br/>

  He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br/>

<p id="id03248">In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br/>

  That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03251">I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br/>

<p id="id03255">As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03257">And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/>

  Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/>

  And the apparel of their Master changed;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03258">So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/>

  Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/>

  Aforetime of my steps beside the river,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03259">And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"<br/>

  And she: "Behold her seated underneath<br/>

  The leafage new, upon the root of it.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03260">Behold the company that circles her;<br/>

  The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/>

  With more melodious song, and more profound."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03261">And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/>

  Because already in my sight was she<br/>

  Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03262">Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/>

  Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/>

  Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03263">Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/>

  The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03264">"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/>

  Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03266">Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/>

<p id="id03267">Never descended with so swift a motion<br/>

  Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/>

<p id="id03268">As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/>

  Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/>

  As well as blossoms and the foliage new,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03269">And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/>

  Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/>

  Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03270">Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/>

  Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/>

  That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03271">But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/>

  My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03272">Then by the way that it before had come,<br/>

  Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle<br/>

  Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03273">And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/>

  A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/>

  "My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03274">Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/>

  Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id03275">And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/>

  Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/>

  Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03276">That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/>

  A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/>

  Perhaps with pure intention and benign,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03277">Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/>

  The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/>

  A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03278">Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/>

  Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/>

<p id="id03279">The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/>

  Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/>

  A monster such had never yet been seen!<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03280">Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/>

  Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/>

  A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03281">And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/>

  Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/>

  And ever and anon they kissed each other.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03282">But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/>

  Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/>

  Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03283">Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/>

  He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/>

  Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<br/>

  To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03293">As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/>

  She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not<br/>

  Venture to question now, in coming with me?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03294">As unto those who are too reverential,<br/>

  Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/>

  Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03295">It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/>

  Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,<br/>

  You know, and that which thereunto is good."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03296">And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness<br/>

  Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/>

  So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03297">Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/>

  Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br/>

  Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03298">Without an heir shall not for ever be<br/>

  The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br/>

  Whence it became a monster, then a prey;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03299">For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br/>

  The stars already near to bring the time,<br/>

  From every hindrance safe, and every bar,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03300">Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br/>

  One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br/>

  And that same giant who is sinning with her.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03301">And peradventure my dark utterance,<br/>

  Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br/>

  Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03302">But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br/>

  Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br/>

  Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03303">Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br/>

  These words, so teach them unto those who live<br/>

  That life which is a running unto death;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03304">And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,<br/>

  Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br/>

  That twice already has been pillaged here.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03305">Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br/>

  With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br/>

  Who made it holy for his use alone.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03306">For biting that, in pain and in desire<br/>

  Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br/>

  Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03307">Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br/>

  For special reason so pre-eminent<br/>

  In height, and so inverted in its summit.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03308">And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br/>

  Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br/>

  And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03309">Thou by so many circumstances only<br/>

  The justice of the interdict of God<br/>

  Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03310">But since I see thee in thine intellect<br/>

  Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br/>

  So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03311">I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br/>

  Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br/>

  That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03312">And I: "As by a signet is the wax<br/>

  Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br/>

  My brain is now imprinted by yourself.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03313">But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br/>

  Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br/>

  The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03314">"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school<br/>

  Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br/>

  Its doctrine follows after my discourse,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03315">And mayst behold your path from the divine<br/>

  Distant as far as separated is<br/>

  From earth the heaven that highest hastens on."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03316">Whence her I answered: "I do not remember<br/>

  That ever I estranged myself from you,<br/>

  Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03317">"And if thou art not able to remember,"<br/>

  Smiling she answered, "recollect thee now<br/>

  That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03318">And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br/>

  Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br/>

  Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03319">Truly from this time forward shall my words<br/>

  Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br/>

  To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03320">And more coruscant and with slower steps<br/>

  The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br/>

  Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03321">When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br/>

  Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br/>

  If something new he find upon his way)<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03322">The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,<br/>

  Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br/>

  The Alp upon its frigid border wears.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03323">In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br/>

  Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br/>

  And slowly part, like friends, from one another.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03324">"O light, O glory of the human race!<br/>

  What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br/>

  From out one source, and from itself withdraws?"<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03325">For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray<br/>

  Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered,<br/>

  As one does who doth free himself from blame,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03326">The beautiful lady: "This and other things<br/>

  Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br/>

  The water of Lethe has not hid them from him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03327">And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care,<br/>

  Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br/>

  Has made the vision of his mind obscure.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03328">But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br/>

  Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br/>

  Revive again the half-dead virtue in him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03329">Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br/>

  But makes its own will of another's will<br/>

  As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03330">Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br/>

  The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br/>

  Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03331">If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br/>

  For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br/>

  Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03332">But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br/>

  Made ready for this second canticle,<br/>

  The curb of art no farther lets me go.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03333">From the most holy water I returned<br/>

  Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br/>

  That are renewed with a new foliage,<br/>
</p>
<p id="id03334">Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p>
