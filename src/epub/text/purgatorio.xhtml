			<h5 id="id01693">PURGATORIO</h5>
			<p>Canto I</p>
			<p>To run o’er better waters hoists its sail<br/> The little vessel of my genius now,<br/> That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;<br/></p>
			<p>And of that second kingdom will I sing<br/> Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br/> And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.<br/></p>
			<p>But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br/> O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br/> And here Calliope somewhat ascend,<br/></p>
			<p>My song accompanying with that sound,<br/> Of which the miserable magpies felt<br/> The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.<br/></p>
			<p>Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br/> That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br/> Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,<br/></p>
			<p>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br/> Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br/> Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.<br/></p>
			<p>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br/> Was making all the orient to laugh,<br/> Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.<br/></p>
			<p>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/> Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/> Ne’er seen before save by the primal people.<br/></p>
			<p>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/> O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/> Because thou art deprived of seeing these!<br/></p>
			<p>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/> Turning a little to the other pole,<br/> There where the Wain had disappeared already,<br/></p>
			<p>I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/> Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/> That more owes not to father any son.<br/></p>
			<p>A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/> He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/> Of which a double list fell on his breast.<br/></p>
			<p>The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/> Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/> That him I saw as were the sun before him.<br/></p>
			<p>“Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/> Have fled away from the eternal prison?”<br/> Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<br/></p>
			<p>“Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/> In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/> That ever black makes the infernal valley?<br/></p>
			<p>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br/> Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/> That being damned ye come unto my crags?”<br/></p>
			<p>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/> And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/> Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;<br/></p>
			<p>Then answered him: “I came not of myself;<br/> A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/> I aided this one with my company.<br/></p>
			<p>But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/> Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/> Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.<br/></p>
			<p>This one has never his last evening seen,<br/> But by his folly was so near to it<br/> That very little time was there to turn.<br/></p>
			<p>As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/> To rescue him, and other way was none<br/> Than this to which I have myself betaken.<br/></p>
			<p>I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,<br/> And now those spirits I intend to show<br/> Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.<br/></p>
			<p>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/> Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/> To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.<br/></p>
			<p>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/> He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/> As knoweth he who life for her refuses.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/> Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br/> The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.<br/></p>
			<p>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br/> Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br/> But of that circle I, where are the chaste<br/></p>
			<p>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br/> O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/> For her love, then, incline thyself to us.<br/></p>
			<p>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/> I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/> If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/> While I was on the other side,” then said he,<br/> “That every grace she wished of me I granted;<br/></p>
			<p>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/> She can no longer move me, by that law<br/> Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.<br/></p>
			<p>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br/> As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/> Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.<br/></p>
			<p>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/> With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/> So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,<br/></p>
			<p>For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast<br/> By any mist should go before the first<br/> Angel, who is of those of Paradise.<br/></p>
			<p>This little island round about its base<br/> Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br/> Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;<br/></p>
			<p>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br/> Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br/> Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereafter be not this way your return;<br/> The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/> To take the mount by easier ascent.”<br/></p>
			<p>With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/> Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/> Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.<br/></p>
			<p>And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;<br/> Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/> The plain unto its lower boundaries.”<br/></p>
			<p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/> Which fled before it, so that from afar<br/> I recognised the trembling of the sea.<br/></p>
			<p>Along the solitary plain we went<br/> As one who unto the lost road returns,<br/> And till he finds it seems to go in vain.<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as we were come to where the dew<br/> Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br/> Where shadow falls, little evaporates,<br/></p>
			<p>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br/> In gentle manner did my Master place;<br/> Whence I, who of his action was aware,<br/></p>
			<p>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/> There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/> That hue which Hell had covered up in me.<br/></p>
			<p>Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/> Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/> Any that afterward had known return.<br/></p>
			<p>There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br/> O marvellous! for even as he culled<br/> The humble plant, such it sprang up again<br/></p>
			<p>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span></p>
			<p>Already had the sun the horizon reached<br/> Whose circle of meridian covers o’er<br/> Jerusalem with its most lofty point,<br/></p>
			<p>And night that opposite to him revolves<br/> Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br/> That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;<br/></p>
			<p>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br/> Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br/> By too great age were changing into orange.<br/></p>
			<p>We still were on the border of the sea,<br/> Like people who are thinking of their road,<br/> Who go in heart and with the body stay;<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br/> Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br/> Down in the West upon the ocean floor,<br/></p>
			<p>Appeared to me⁠—may I again behold it!⁠—<br/> A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br/> Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;<br/></p>
			<p>From which when I a little had withdrawn<br/> Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br/> Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.<br/></p>
			<p>Then on each side of it appeared to me<br/> I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br/> Little by little there came forth another.<br/></p>
			<p>My Master yet had uttered not a word<br/> While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/> But when he clearly recognised the pilot,<br/></p>
			<p>He cried: “Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/> Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br/> Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!<br/></p>
			<p>See how he scorneth human arguments,<br/> So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br/> Than his own wings, between so distant shores.<br/></p>
			<p>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br/> Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br/> That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”<br/></p>
			<p>Then as still nearer and more near us came<br/> The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/> So that near by the eye could not endure him,<br/></p>
			<p>But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/> With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/> So that the water swallowed naught thereof.<br/></p>
			<p>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br/> Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br/> And more than a hundred spirits sat within.<br/></p>
			<p>“In exitu Israel de Aegypto!”<br/> They chanted all together in one voice,<br/> With whatso in that psalm is after written.<br/></p>
			<p>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br/> Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br/> And he departed swiftly as he came.<br/></p>
			<p>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br/> Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br/> As one who in new matters makes essay.<br/></p>
			<p>On every side was darting forth the day.<br/> The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br/> From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,<br/></p>
			<p>When the new people lifted up their faces<br/> Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,<br/> Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”<br/></p>
			<p>And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe<br/> Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br/> But we are strangers even as yourselves.<br/></p>
			<p>Just now we came, a little while before you,<br/> Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br/> That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”<br/></p>
			<p>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br/> Become aware that I was still alive,<br/> Pallid in their astonishment became;<br/></p>
			<p>And as to messenger who bears the olive<br/> The people throng to listen to the news,<br/> And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,<br/></p>
			<p>So at the sight of me stood motionless<br/> Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br/> Oblivious to go and make them fair.<br/></p>
			<p>One from among them saw I coming forward,<br/> As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br/> That it incited me to do the like.<br/></p>
			<p>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br/> Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br/> As oft returned with them to my own breast!<br/></p>
			<p>I think with wonder I depicted me;<br/> Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br/> And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.<br/></p>
			<p>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br/> Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br/> That it would stop awhile to speak with me.<br/></p>
			<p>It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee<br/> In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br/> Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”<br/></p>
			<p>“My own Casella! to return once more<br/> There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;<br/> “But how from thee has so much time be taken?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,<br/> If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br/> Has many times denied to me this passage,<br/></p>
			<p>For of a righteous will his own is made.<br/> He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br/> Whoever wished to enter with all peace;<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br/> Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br/> Benignantly by him have been received.<br/></p>
			<p>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br/> Because for evermore assemble there<br/> Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “If some new law take not from thee<br/> Memory or practice of the song of love,<br/> Which used to quiet in me all my longings,<br/></p>
			<p>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br/> Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br/> Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Love, that within my mind discourses with me,”<br/> Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br/> The melody within me still is sounding.<br/></p>
			<p>My Master, and myself, and all that people<br/> Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br/> As if naught else might touch the mind of any.<br/></p>
			<p>We all of us were moveless and attentive<br/> Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br/> Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?<br/></p>
			<p>What negligence, what standing still is this?<br/> Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br/> That lets not God be manifest to you.”<br/></p>
			<p>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br/> The doves, together at their pasture met,<br/> Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,<br/></p>
			<p>If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br/> Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br/> Because they are assailed by greater care;<br/></p>
			<p>So that fresh company did I behold<br/> The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,<br/> As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;<br/></p>
			<p>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></p>
			<p>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br/> Had scattered them asunder o’er the plain,<br/> Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,<br/></p>
			<p>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br/> And how without him had I kept my course?<br/> Who would have led me up along the mountain?<br/></p>
			<p>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br/> O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br/> How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!<br/></p>
			<p>After his feet had laid aside the haste<br/> Which mars the dignity of every act,<br/> My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,<br/></p>
			<p>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br/> And I my sight directed to the hill<br/> That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.<br/></p>
			<p>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br/> Was broken in front of me into the figure<br/> Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;<br/></p>
			<p>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br/> Of being left alone, when I beheld<br/> Only in front of me the ground obscured.<br/></p>
			<p>“Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter<br/> Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br/> “Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?<br/></p>
			<p>’Tis evening there already where is buried<br/> The body within which I cast a shadow;<br/> ’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.<br/></p>
			<p>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br/> Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br/> Because one ray impedeth not another<br/></p>
			<p>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br/> Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br/> That how it works be not unveiled to us.<br/></p>
			<p>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br/> Can traverse the illimitable way,<br/> Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!<br/></p>
			<p>Mortals, remain contented at the ‘Quia;’<br/> For if ye had been able to see all,<br/> No need there were for Mary to give birth;<br/></p>
			<p>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br/> Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br/> Which evermore is given them for a grief.<br/></p>
			<p>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br/> And many others;”⁠—and here bowed his head,<br/> And more he said not, and remained disturbed.<br/></p>
			<p>We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;<br/> There so precipitate we found the rock,<br/> That nimble legs would there have been in vain.<br/></p>
			<p>’Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br/> The most secluded pathway is a stair<br/> Easy and open, if compared with that.<br/></p>
			<p>“Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br/> Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br/> “So that who goeth without wings may mount?”<br/></p>
			<p>And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br/> Examining the nature of the path,<br/> And I was looking up around the rock,<br/></p>
			<p>On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br/> Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br/> And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.<br/></p>
			<p>“Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;<br/> “Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br/> If thou of thine own self can have it not.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br/> Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br/> And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”<br/></p>
			<p>Still was that people as far off from us,<br/> After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br/> As a good thrower with his hand would reach,<br/></p>
			<p>When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br/> Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br/> As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.<br/></p>
			<p>“O happy dead! O spirits elect already!”<br/> Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace<br/> Which I believe is waiting for you all,<br/></p>
			<p>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br/> So that the going up be possible,<br/> For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”<br/></p>
			<p>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br/> By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br/> Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,<br/></p>
			<p>And what the foremost does the others do,<br/> Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br/> Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;<br/></p>
			<p>So moving to approach us thereupon<br/> I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br/> Modest in face and dignified in gait.<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br/> The light upon the ground at my right side,<br/> So that from me the shadow reached the rock,<br/></p>
			<p>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br/> And all the others, who came after them,<br/> Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.<br/></p>
			<p>“Without your asking, I confess to you<br/> This is a human body which you see,<br/> Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.<br/></p>
			<p>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br/> That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br/> Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.”<br/></p>
			<p>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br/> “Return ye then, and enter in before us,”<br/> Making a signal with the back o’ the hand<br/></p>
			<p>And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,<br/> Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br/> If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”<br/></p>
			<p>I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;<br/> Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br/> But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.<br/></p>
			<p>When with humility I had disclaimed<br/> E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he said,<br/> And showed me high upon his breast a wound.<br/></p>
			<p>Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,<br/> The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<br/> Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee<br/></p>
			<p>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<br/> Of Sicily’s honour and of Aragon’s,<br/> And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.<br/></p>
			<p>After I had my body lacerated<br/> By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself<br/> Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.<br/></p>
			<p>Horrible my iniquities had been;<br/> But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,<br/> That it receives whatever turns to it.<br/></p>
			<p>Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase<br/> Of me was sent by Clement at that time,<br/> In God read understandingly this page,<br/></p>
			<p>The bones of my dead body still would be<br/> At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,<br/> Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.<br/></p>
			<p>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,<br/> Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<br/> Where he transported them with tapers quenched.<br/></p>
			<p>By malison of theirs is not so lost<br/> Eternal Love, that it cannot return,<br/> So long as hope has anything of green.<br/></p>
			<p>True is it, who in contumacy dies<br/> Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,<br/> Must wait upon the outside this bank<br/></p>
			<p>Thirty times told the time that he has been<br/> In his presumption, unless such decree<br/> Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.<br/></p>
			<p>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,<br/> By making known unto my good Costanza<br/> How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,<br/></p>
			<p>For those on earth can much advance us here.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span></p>
			<p>Whenever by delight or else by pain,<br/> That seizes any faculty of ours,<br/> Wholly to that the soul collects itself,<br/></p>
			<p>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;<br/> And this against that error is which thinks<br/> One soul above another kindles in us.<br/></p>
			<p>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen<br/> Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,<br/> Time passes on, and we perceive it not,<br/></p>
			<p>Because one faculty is that which listens,<br/> And other that which the soul keeps entire;<br/> This is as if in bonds, and that is free.<br/></p>
			<p>Of this I had experience positive<br/> In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;<br/> For fifty full degrees uprisen was<br/></p>
			<p>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when<br/> We came to where those souls with one accord<br/> Cried out unto us: “Here is what you ask.”<br/></p>
			<p>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up<br/> With but a little forkful of his thorns<br/> The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,<br/></p>
			<p>Than was the passage-way through which ascended<br/> Only my Leader and myself behind him,<br/> After that company departed from us.<br/></p>
			<p>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,<br/> And mounts the summit of Bismantova,<br/> With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;<br/></p>
			<p>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say<br/> Of great desire, conducted after him<br/> Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.<br/></p>
			<p>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,<br/> And on each side the border pressed upon us,<br/> And feet and hands the ground beneath required.<br/></p>
			<p>When we were come upon the upper rim<br/> Of the high bank, out on the open slope,<br/> “My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “No step of thine descend;<br/> Still up the mount behind me win thy way,<br/> Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”<br/></p>
			<p>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,<br/> And the hillside precipitous far more<br/> Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.<br/></p>
			<p>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<br/> “O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold<br/> How I remain alone, unless thou stay!”<br/></p>
			<p>“O son,” he said, “up yonder drag thyself,”<br/> Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,<br/> Which on that side encircles all the hill.<br/></p>
			<p>These words of his so spurred me on, that I<br/> Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,<br/> Until the circle was beneath my feet.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us<br/> Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,<br/> For all men are delighted to look back.<br/></p>
			<p>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,<br/> Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered<br/> That on the left hand we were smitten by it.<br/></p>
			<p>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly<br/> Bewildered at the chariot of the light,<br/> Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.<br/></p>
			<p>Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux<br/> Were in the company of yonder mirror,<br/> That up and down conducteth with its light,<br/></p>
			<p>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac’s jagged wheel<br/> Revolving still more near unto the Bears,<br/> Unless it swerved aside from its old track.<br/></p>
			<p>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,<br/> Collected in thyself, imagine Zion<br/> Together with this mount on earth to stand,<br/></p>
			<p>So that they both one sole horizon have,<br/> And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road<br/> Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,<br/></p>
			<p>Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass<br/> This on one side, when that upon the other,<br/> If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet<br/> Saw I so clearly as I now discern,<br/> There where my wit appeared incompetent,<br/></p>
			<p>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br/> Which in some art is the Equator called,<br/> And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,<br/></p>
			<p>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence<br/> Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<br/> Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.<br/></p>
			<p>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br/> How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br/> Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever<br/> At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,<br/> And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br/> That going up shall be to thee as easy<br/> As going down the current in a boat,<br/></p>
			<p>Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;<br/> There to repose thy panting breath expect;<br/> No more I answer; and this I know for true.”<br/></p>
			<p>And as he finished uttering these words,<br/> A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure<br/> Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”<br/></p>
			<p>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br/> And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br/> Which neither I nor he before had noticed.<br/></p>
			<p>Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br/> Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br/> As one through indolence is wont to stand.<br/></p>
			<p>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br/> Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br/> Holding his face low down between them bowed.<br/></p>
			<p>“O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye<br/> On him who shows himself more negligent<br/> Then even Sloth herself his sister were.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br/> Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br/> And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br/> That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br/> My going to him hindered not; and after<br/></p>
			<p>I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br/> Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br/> O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”<br/></p>
			<p>His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/> A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br/> Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not<br/></p>
			<p>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br/> In this place art thou? Waitest thou an escort?<br/> Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?<br/> Since to my torment would not let me go<br/> The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.<br/></p>
			<p>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br/> Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br/> Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,<br/></p>
			<p>Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid<br/> Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;<br/> What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”<br/></p>
			<p>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,<br/> And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched<br/> Meridian, and from the shore the night<br/></p>
			<p>Covers already with her foot Morocco.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span></p>
			<p>I had already from those shades departed,<br/> And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,<br/> When from behind, pointing his finger at me,<br/></p>
			<p>One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not<br/> The sunshine on the left of him below,<br/> And like one living seems he to conduct him.”<br/></p>
			<p>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,<br/> And saw them watching with astonishment<br/> But me, but me, and the light which was broken!<br/></p>
			<p>“Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”<br/> The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?<br/> What matters it to thee what here is whispered?<br/></p>
			<p>Come after me, and let the people talk;<br/> Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags<br/> Its top for all the blowing of the winds;<br/></p>
			<p>For evermore the man in whom is springing<br/> Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,<br/> Because the force of one the other weakens.”<br/></p>
			<p>What could I say in answer but “I come”?<br/> I said it somewhat with that colour tinged<br/> Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.<br/></p>
			<p>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br/> Came people in advance of us a little,<br/> Singing the Miserere verse by verse.<br/></p>
			<p>When they became aware I gave no place<br/> For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br/> They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”<br/></p>
			<p>And two of them, in form of messengers,<br/> Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br/> “Of your condition make us cognisant.”<br/></p>
			<p>And said my Master: “Ye can go your way<br/> And carry back again to those who sent you,<br/> That this one’s body is of very flesh.<br/></p>
			<p>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,<br/> As I suppose, enough is answered them;<br/> Him let them honour, it may profit them.”<br/></p>
			<p>Vapours enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly<br/> At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<br/> Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,<br/></p>
			<p>But upward they returned in briefer time,<br/> And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br/> Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.<br/></p>
			<p>“This folk that presses unto us is great,<br/> And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;<br/> “So still go onward, and in going listen.”<br/></p>
			<p>“O soul that goest to beatitude<br/> With the same members wherewith thou wast born,”<br/> Shouting they came, “a little stay thy steps,<br/></p>
			<p>Look, if thou e’er hast any of us seen,<br/> So that o’er yonder thou bear news of him;<br/> Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why not stay?<br/></p>
			<p>Long since we all were slain by violence,<br/> And sinners even to the latest hour;<br/> Then did a light from heaven admonish us,<br/></p>
			<p>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br/> From life we issued reconciled to God,<br/> Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “Although I gaze into your faces,<br/> No one I recognize; but if may please you<br/> Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,<br/></p>
			<p>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace<br/> Which, following the feet of such a Guide,<br/> From world to world makes itself sought by me.”<br/></p>
			<p>And one began: “Each one has confidence<br/> In thy good offices without an oath,<br/> Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<br/> Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land<br/> That ’twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,<br/></p>
			<p>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers<br/> In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,<br/> That I may purge away my grave offences.<br/></p>
			<p>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which<br/> Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<br/> Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,<br/></p>
			<p>There where I thought to be the most secure;<br/> ’Twas he of Este had it done, who held me<br/> In hatred far beyond what justice willed.<br/></p>
			<p>But if towards the Mira I had fled,<br/> When I was overtaken at Oriaco,<br/> I still should be o’er yonder where men breathe.<br/></p>
			<p>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br/> Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br/> A lake made from my veins upon the ground.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then said another: “Ah, be that desire<br/> Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,<br/> As thou with pious pity aidest mine.<br/></p>
			<p>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<br/> Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;<br/> Hence among these I go with downcast front.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him: “What violence or what chance<br/> Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<br/> That never has thy sepulture been known?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Oh,” he replied, “at Casentino’s foot<br/> A river crosses named Archiano, born<br/> Above the Hermitage in Apennine.<br/></p>
			<p>There where the name thereof becometh void<br/> Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br/> Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;<br/></p>
			<p>There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br/> Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br/> I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.<br/></p>
			<p>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br/> God’s Angel took me up, and he of hell<br/> Shouted: ‘O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?<br/></p>
			<p>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,<br/> For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;<br/> But with the rest I’ll deal in other fashion!’<br/></p>
			<p>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<br/> That humid vapour which to water turns,<br/> Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.<br/></p>
			<p>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<br/> To intellect, and moved the mist and wind<br/> By means of power, which his own nature gave;<br/></p>
			<p>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley<br/> From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<br/> With fog, and made the heaven above intent,<br/></p>
			<p>So that the pregnant air to water changed;<br/> Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came<br/> Whate’er of it earth tolerated not;<br/></p>
			<p>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,<br/> Towards the royal river with such speed<br/> It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.<br/></p>
			<p>My frozen body near unto its outlet<br/> The robust Archian found, and into Arno<br/> Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross<br/></p>
			<p>I made of me, when agony o’ercame me;<br/> It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,<br/> Then with its booty covered and begirt me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,<br/> And rested thee from thy long journeying,”<br/> After the second followed the third spirit,<br/></p>
			<p>“Do thou remember me who am the Pia;<br/> Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;<br/> He knoweth it, who had encircled first,<br/></p>
			<p>Espousing me, my finger with his gem.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span></p>
			<p>Whene’er is broken up the game of Zara,<br/> He who has lost remains behind despondent,<br/> The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;<br/></p>
			<p>The people with the other all depart;<br/> One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,<br/> And at his side one brings himself to mind;<br/></p>
			<p>He pauses not, and this and that one hears;<br/> They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,<br/> And from the throng he thus defends himself.<br/></p>
			<p>Even such was I in that dense multitude,<br/> Turning to them this way and that my face,<br/> And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.<br/></p>
			<p>There was the Aretine, who from the arms<br/> Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,<br/> And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.<br/></p>
			<p>There was imploring with his hands outstretched<br/> Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa<br/> Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided<br/> By hatred and by envy from its body,<br/> As it declared, and not for crime committed,<br/></p>
			<p>Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide<br/> While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,<br/> So that for this she be of no worse flock!<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as I was free from all those shades<br/> Who only prayed that some one else may pray,<br/> So as to hasten their becoming holy,<br/></p>
			<p>Began I: “It appears that thou deniest,<br/> O light of mine, expressly in some text,<br/> That orison can bend decree of Heaven;<br/></p>
			<p>And ne’ertheless these people pray for this.<br/> Might then their expectation bootless be?<br/> Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “My writing is explicit,<br/> And not fallacious is the hope of these,<br/> If with sane intellect ’tis well regarded;<br/></p>
			<p>For top of judgment doth not vail itself,<br/> Because the fire of love fulfils at once<br/> What he must satisfy who here installs him.<br/></p>
			<p>And there, where I affirmed that proposition,<br/> Defect was not amended by a prayer,<br/> Because the prayer from God was separate.<br/></p>
			<p>Verily, in so deep a questioning<br/> Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,<br/> Who light ’twixt truth and intellect shall be.<br/></p>
			<p>I know not if thou understand; I speak<br/> Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,<br/> Smiling and happy, on this mountain’s top.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “Good Leader, let us make more haste,<br/> For I no longer tire me as before;<br/> And see, e’en now the hill a shadow casts.”<br/></p>
			<p>“We will go forward with this day” he answered,<br/> “As far as now is possible for us;<br/> But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.<br/></p>
			<p>Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return<br/> Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,<br/> So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.<br/></p>
			<p>But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed<br/> All, all alone is looking hitherward;<br/> It will point out to us the quickest way.”<br/></p>
			<p>We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,<br/> How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,<br/> And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!<br/></p>
			<p>Nothing whatever did it say to us,<br/> But let us go our way, eying us only<br/> After the manner of a couchant lion;<br/></p>
			<p>Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating<br/> That it would point us out the best ascent;<br/> And it replied not unto his demand,<br/></p>
			<p>But of our native land and of our life<br/> It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:<br/> “Mantua,”⁠—and the shade, all in itself recluse,<br/></p>
			<p>Rose tow’rds him from the place where first it was,<br/> Saying: “O Mantuan, I am Sordello<br/> Of thine own land!” and one embraced the other.<br/></p>
			<p>Ah! servile Italy, grief’s hostelry!<br/> A ship without a pilot in great tempest!<br/> No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!<br/></p>
			<p>That noble soul was so impatient, only<br/> At the sweet sound of his own native land,<br/> To make its citizen glad welcome there;<br/></p>
			<p>And now within thee are not without war<br/> Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other<br/> Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!<br/></p>
			<p>Search, wretched one, all round about the shores<br/> Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,<br/> If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!<br/></p>
			<p>What boots it, that for thee Justinian<br/> The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?<br/> Withouten this the shame would be the less.<br/></p>
			<p>Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,<br/> And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,<br/> If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,<br/></p>
			<p>Behold how fell this wild beast has become,<br/> Being no longer by the spur corrected,<br/> Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.<br/></p>
			<p>O German Albert! who abandonest<br/> Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,<br/> And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,<br/></p>
			<p>May a just judgment from the stars down fall<br/> Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,<br/> That thy successor may have fear thereof;<br/></p>
			<p>Because thy father and thyself have suffered,<br/> By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,<br/> The garden of the empire to be waste.<br/></p>
			<p>Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,<br/> Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!<br/> Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!<br/></p>
			<p>Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression<br/> Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,<br/> And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!<br/></p>
			<p>Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,<br/> Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,<br/> “My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?”<br/></p>
			<p>Come and behold how loving are the people;<br/> And if for us no pity moveth thee,<br/> Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!<br/></p>
			<p>And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!<br/> Who upon earth for us wast crucified,<br/> Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?<br/></p>
			<p>Or preparation is ‘t, that, in the abyss<br/> Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest<br/> From our perception utterly cut off?<br/></p>
			<p>For all the towns of Italy are full<br/> Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus<br/> Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!<br/></p>
			<p>My Florence! well mayst thou contented be<br/> With this digression, which concerns thee not,<br/> Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!<br/></p>
			<p>Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,<br/> That unadvised they come not to the bow,<br/> But on their very lips thy people have it!<br/></p>
			<p>Many refuse to bear the common burden;<br/> But thy solicitous people answereth<br/> Without being asked, and crieth: “I submit.”<br/></p>
			<p>Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;<br/> Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!<br/> If I speak true, the event conceals it not.<br/></p>
			<p>Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made<br/> The ancient laws, and were so civilized,<br/> Made towards living well a little sign<br/></p>
			<p>Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun<br/> Provisions, that to middle of November<br/> Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.<br/></p>
			<p>How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,<br/> Laws, money, offices, and usages<br/> Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?<br/></p>
			<p>And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,<br/> Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,<br/> Who cannot find repose upon her down,<br/></p>
			<p>But by her tossing wardeth off her pain.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span></p>
			<p>After the gracious and glad salutations<br/> Had three and four times been reiterated,<br/> Sordello backward drew and said, “Who are you?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Or ever to this mountain were directed<br/> The souls deserving to ascend to God,<br/> My bones were buried by Octavian.<br/></p>
			<p>I am Virgilius; and for no crime else<br/> Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;”<br/> In this wise then my Leader made reply.<br/></p>
			<p>As one who suddenly before him sees<br/> Something whereat he marvels, who believes<br/> And yet does not, saying, “It is! it is not!”<br/></p>
			<p>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,<br/> And with humility returned towards him,<br/> And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.<br/></p>
			<p>“O glory of the Latians, thou,” he said,<br/> “Through whom our language showed what it could do<br/> O pride eternal of the place I came from,<br/></p>
			<p>What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?<br/> If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me<br/> If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Through all the circles of the doleful realm,”<br/> Responded he, “have I come hitherward;<br/> Heaven’s power impelled me, and with that I come.<br/></p>
			<p>I by not doing, not by doing, lost<br/> The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,<br/> And which too late by me was recognized.<br/></p>
			<p>A place there is below not sad with torments,<br/> But darkness only, where the lamentations<br/> Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.<br/></p>
			<p>There dwell I with the little innocents<br/> Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they<br/> Were from our human sinfulness exempt.<br/></p>
			<p>There dwell I among those who the three saintly<br/> Virtues did not put on, and without vice<br/> The others knew and followed all of them.<br/></p>
			<p>But if thou know and can, some indication<br/> Give us by which we may the sooner come<br/> Where Purgatory has its right beginning.”<br/></p>
			<p>He answered: “No fixed place has been assigned us;<br/> ’Tis lawful for me to go up and round;<br/> So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.<br/></p>
			<p>But see already how the day declines,<br/> And to go up by night we are not able;<br/> Therefore ’tis well to think of some fair sojourn.<br/></p>
			<p>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;<br/> If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,<br/> And thou shalt know them not without delight.”<br/></p>
			<p>“How is this?” was the answer; “should one wish<br/> To mount by night would he prevented be<br/> By others? or mayhap would not have power?”<br/></p>
			<p>And on the ground the good Sordello drew<br/> His finger, saying, “See, this line alone<br/> Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;<br/></p>
			<p>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,<br/> To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;<br/> This with the want of power the will perplexes.<br/></p>
			<p>We might indeed therewith return below,<br/> And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,<br/> While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:<br/> “Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest<br/> That we can take delight in tarrying.”<br/></p>
			<p>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,<br/> When I perceived the mount was hollowed out<br/> In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.<br/></p>
			<p>“Thitherward,” said that shade, “will we repair,<br/> Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,<br/> And there for the new day will we await.”<br/></p>
			<p>’Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path<br/> Which led us to the margin of that dell,<br/> Where dies the border more than half away.<br/></p>
			<p>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,<br/> The Indian wood resplendent and serene,<br/> Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,<br/></p>
			<p>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow<br/> Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,<br/> As by its greater vanquished is the less.<br/></p>
			<p>Nor in that place had nature painted only,<br/> But of the sweetness of a thousand odours<br/> Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.<br/></p>
			<p>“Salve Regina,” on the green and flowers<br/> There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,<br/> Which were not visible outside the valley.<br/></p>
			<p>“Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,”<br/> Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,<br/> “Among them do not wish me to conduct you.<br/></p>
			<p>Better from off this ledge the acts and faces<br/> Of all of them will you discriminate,<br/> Than in the plain below received among them.<br/></p>
			<p>He who sits highest, and the semblance bears<br/> Of having what he should have done neglected,<br/> And to the others’ song moves not his lips,<br/></p>
			<p>Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power<br/> To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,<br/> So that through others slowly she revives.<br/></p>
			<p>The other, who in look doth comfort him,<br/> Governed the region where the water springs,<br/> The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.<br/></p>
			<p>His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes<br/> Far better he than bearded Winceslaus<br/> His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.<br/></p>
			<p>And the small-nosed, who close in council seems<br/> With him that has an aspect so benign,<br/> Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;<br/></p>
			<p>Look there, how he is beating at his breast!<br/> Behold the other one, who for his cheek<br/> Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;<br/></p>
			<p>Father and father-in-law of France’s Pest<br/> Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,<br/> And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.<br/></p>
			<p>He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,<br/> Singing, with that one of the manly nose,<br/> The cord of every valour wore begirt;<br/></p>
			<p>And if as King had after him remained<br/> The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,<br/> Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,<br/></p>
			<p>Which cannot of the other heirs be said.<br/> Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,<br/> But none the better heritage possesses.<br/></p>
			<p>Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches<br/> The probity of man; and this He wills<br/> Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.<br/></p>
			<p>Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less<br/> Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;<br/> Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already<br/></p>
			<p>The plant is as inferior to its seed,<br/> As more than Beatrice and Margaret<br/> Costanza boasteth of her husband still.<br/></p>
			<p>Behold the monarch of the simple life,<br/> Harry of England, sitting there alone;<br/> He in his branches has a better issue.<br/></p>
			<p>He who the lowest on the ground among them<br/> Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,<br/> For whose sake Alessandria and her war<br/></p>
			<p>Make Monferrat and Canavese weep.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span></p>
			<p>’Twas now the hour that turneth back desire<br/> In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,<br/> The day they’ve said to their sweet friends farewell,<br/></p>
			<p>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,<br/> If he doth hear from far away a bell<br/> That seemeth to deplore the dying day,<br/></p>
			<p>When I began to make of no avail<br/> My hearing, and to watch one of the souls<br/> Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.<br/></p>
			<p>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,<br/> Fixing its eyes upon the orient,<br/> As if it said to God, “Naught else I care for.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Te lucis ante” so devoutly issued<br/> Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,<br/> It made me issue forth from my own mind.<br/></p>
			<p>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,<br/> Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,<br/> Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.<br/></p>
			<p>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,<br/> For now indeed so subtile is the veil,<br/> Surely to penetrate within is easy.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw that army of the gentle-born<br/> Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,<br/> As if in expectation, pale and humble;<br/></p>
			<p>And from on high come forth and down descend,<br/> I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<br/> Truncated and deprived of their points.<br/></p>
			<p>Green as the little leaflets just now born<br/> Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions<br/> Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.<br/></p>
			<p>One just above us came to take his station,<br/> And one descended to the opposite bank,<br/> So that the people were contained between them.<br/></p>
			<p>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;<br/> But in their faces was the eye bewildered,<br/> As faculty confounded by excess.<br/></p>
			<p>“From Mary’s bosom both of them have come,”<br/> Sordello said, “as guardians of the valley<br/> Against the serpent, that will come anon.”<br/></p>
			<p>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,<br/> Turned round about, and closely drew myself,<br/> Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.<br/></p>
			<p>And once again Sordello: “Now descend we<br/> ‘Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;<br/> Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.”<br/></p>
			<p>Only three steps I think that I descended,<br/> And was below, and saw one who was looking<br/> Only at me, as if he fain would know me.<br/></p>
			<p>Already now the air was growing dark,<br/> But not so that between his eyes and mine<br/> It did not show what it before locked up.<br/></p>
			<p>Tow’rds me he moved, and I tow’rds him did move;<br/> Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<br/> When I beheld thee not among the damned!<br/></p>
			<p>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;<br/> Then asked he: “How long is it since thou camest<br/> O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Oh!” said I to him, “through the dismal places<br/> I came this morn; and am in the first life,<br/> Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.”<br/></p>
			<p>And on the instant my reply was heard,<br/> He and Sordello both shrank back from me,<br/> Like people who are suddenly bewildered.<br/></p>
			<p>One to Virgilius, and the other turned<br/> To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!<br/> Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”<br/></p>
			<p>Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace<br/> Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals<br/> His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,<br/></p>
			<p>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,<br/> Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<br/> Where answer to the innocent is made.<br/></p>
			<p>I do not think her mother loves me more,<br/> Since she has laid aside her wimple white,<br/> Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.<br/></p>
			<p>Through her full easily is comprehended<br/> How long in woman lasts the fire of love,<br/> If eye or touch do not relight it often.<br/></p>
			<p>So fair a hatchment will not make for her<br/> The Viper marshalling the Milanese<br/> A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”<br/></p>
			<p>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed<br/> Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal<br/> Which measurably burneth in the heart.<br/></p>
			<p>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,<br/> Still to that point where slowest are the stars,<br/> Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.<br/></p>
			<p>And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at<br/> Up there?” And I to him: “At those three torches<br/> With which this hither pole is all on fire.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “The four resplendent stars<br/> Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,<br/> And these have mounted up to where those were.”<br/></p>
			<p>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello<br/> Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”<br/> And pointed with his finger to look thither.<br/></p>
			<p>Upon the side on which the little valley<br/> No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance<br/> The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.<br/></p>
			<p>’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<br/> Turning at times its head about, and licking<br/> Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.<br/></p>
			<p>I did not see, and therefore cannot say<br/> How the celestial falcons ‘gan to move,<br/> But well I saw that they were both in motion.<br/></p>
			<p>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,<br/> The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,<br/> Up to their stations flying back alike.<br/></p>
			<p>The shade that to the Judge had near approached<br/> When he had called, throughout that whole assault<br/> Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.<br/></p>

			<p>That fame, which doeth honour to your house,<br/> Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,<br/> So that he knows of them who ne’er was there.<br/></p>

			<p>It is so privileged by use and nature,<br/> That though a guilty head misguide the world,<br/> Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.”<br/></p>

			<p>The concubine of old Tithonus now<br/> Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<br/> Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;<br/></p>
			<p>With gems her forehead all relucent was,<br/> Set in the shape of that cold animal<br/> Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,<br/></p>
			<p>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night<br/> Had taken two in that place where we were,<br/> And now the third was bending down its wings;<br/></p>
			<p>When I, who something had of Adam in me,<br/> Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,<br/> There were all five of us already sat.<br/></p>
			<p>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins<br/> The little swallow, near unto the morning,<br/> Perchance in memory of her former woes,<br/></p>
			<p>And when the mind of man, a wanderer<br/> More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,<br/> Almost prophetic in its visions is,<br/></p>
			<p>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended<br/> An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,<br/> With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,<br/></p>
			<p>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<br/> By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,<br/> When to the high consistory he was rapt.<br/></p>
			<p>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes<br/> From habit only here, and from elsewhere<br/> Disdains to bear up any in his feet.<br/></p>
			<p>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,<br/> Terrible as the lightning he descended,<br/> And snatched me upward even to the fire.<br/></p>
			<p>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,<br/> And the imagined fire did scorch me so,<br/> That of necessity my sleep was broken.<br/></p>
			<p>Not otherwise Achilles started up,<br/> Around him turning his awakened eyes,<br/> And knowing not the place in which he was,<br/></p>
			<p>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<br/> Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,<br/> Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,<br/></p>
			<p>Than I upstarted, when from off my face<br/> Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,<br/> As doth the man who freezes with affright.<br/></p>
			<p>Only my Comforter was at my side,<br/> And now the sun was more than two hours high,<br/> And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.<br/></p>
			<p>“Be not intimidated,” said my Lord,<br/> “Be reassured, for all is well with us;<br/> Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;<br/> See there the cliff that closes it around;<br/> See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.<br/></p>
			<p>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,<br/> When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<br/> Upon the flowers that deck the land below,<br/></p>
			<p>There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucia;<br/> Let me take this one up, who is asleep;<br/> So will I make his journey easier for him.’<br/></p>
			<p>Sordello and the other noble shapes<br/> Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,<br/> Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.<br/></p>
			<p>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes<br/> That open entrance pointed out to me;<br/> Then she and sleep together went away.”<br/></p>
			<p>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,<br/> And who to confidence his fear doth change,<br/> After the truth has been discovered to him,<br/></p>
			<p>So did I change; and when without disquiet<br/> My Leader saw me, up along the cliff<br/> He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.<br/></p>
			<p>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt<br/> My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br/> I fortify it, marvel not thereat.<br/></p>
			<p>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br/> That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br/> Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,<br/></p>
			<p>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br/> Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br/> And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.<br/></p>
			<p>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br/> I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br/> Such in the face that I endured it not.<br/></p>
			<p>And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br/> Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,<br/> That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.<br/></p>
			<p>“Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”<br/> Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?<br/> Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”<br/></p>
			<p>“A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”<br/> My Master answered him, “but even now<br/> Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’ ”<br/></p>
			<p>“And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”<br/> Again began the courteous janitor;<br/> “Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br/> Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br/> I mirrored myself therein as I appear.<br/></p>
			<p>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br/> Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br/> Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.<br/></p>
			<p>The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br/> Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br/> As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.<br/></p>
			<p>Both of his feet was holding upon this<br/> The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br/> Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.<br/></p>
			<p>Along the three stairs upward with good will<br/> Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask<br/> Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”<br/></p>
			<p>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br/> For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,<br/> But first upon my breast three times I smote.<br/></p>
			<p>Seven P’s upon my forehead he described<br/> With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash<br/> These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.<br/></p>
			<p>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br/> Of the same colour were with his attire,<br/> And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.<br/></p>
			<p>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br/> First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br/> Plied he the door, so that I was content.<br/></p>
			<p>“Whenever faileth either of these keys<br/> So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”<br/> He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.<br/></p>
			<p>More precious one is, but the other needs<br/> More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br/> For it is that which doth the knot unloose.<br/></p>
			<p>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err<br/> Rather in opening than in keeping shut,<br/> If people but fall down before my feet.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,<br/> Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning<br/> That forth returns whoever looks behind.”<br/></p>
			<p>And when upon their hinges were turned round<br/> The swivels of that consecrated gate,<br/> Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,<br/></p>
			<p>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<br/> Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good<br/> Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.<br/></p>
			<p>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br/> And “Te Deum laudamus” seemed to hear<br/> In voices mingled with sweet melody.<br/></p>
			<p>Exactly such an image rendered me<br/> That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br/> When people singing with the organ stand;<br/></p>
			<p>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span></p>
			<p>When we had crossed the threshold of the door<br/> Which the perverted love of souls disuses,<br/> Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,<br/></p>
			<p>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;<br/> And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,<br/> What for my failing had been fit excuse?<br/></p>
			<p>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,<br/> Which undulated to this side and that,<br/> Even as a wave receding and advancing.<br/></p>
			<p>“Here it behoves us use a little art,”<br/> Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves<br/> Now here, now there, to the receding side.”<br/></p>
			<p>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,<br/> That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk<br/> Regained its bed to sink again to rest,<br/></p>
			<p>Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;<br/> But when we free and in the open were,<br/> There where the mountain backward piles itself,<br/></p>
			<p>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain<br/> About our way, we stopped upon a plain<br/> More desolate than roads across the deserts.<br/></p>
			<p>From where its margin borders on the void,<br/> To foot of the high bank that ever rises,<br/> A human body three times told would measure;<br/></p>
			<p>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,<br/> Now on the left, and on the right flank now,<br/> The same this cornice did appear to me.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,<br/> When I perceived the embankment round about,<br/> Which all right of ascent had interdicted,<br/></p>
			<p>To be of marble white, and so adorned<br/> With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<br/> But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.<br/></p>
			<p>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings<br/> Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,<br/> And opened Heaven from its long interdict,<br/></p>
			<p>In front of us appeared so truthfully<br/> There sculptured in a gracious attitude,<br/> He did not seem an image that is silent.<br/></p>
			<p>One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave;”<br/> For she was there in effigy portrayed<br/> Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,<br/></p>
			<p>And in her mien this language had impressed,<br/> “Ecce ancilla Dei,” as distinctly<br/> As any figure stamps itself in wax.<br/></p>
			<p>“Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”<br/> The gentle Master said, who had me standing<br/> Upon that side where people have their hearts;<br/></p>
			<p>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld<br/> In rear of Mary, and upon that side<br/> Where he was standing who conducted me,<br/></p>
			<p>Another story on the rock imposed;<br/> Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,<br/> So that before mine eyes it might be set.<br/></p>
			<p>There sculptured in the self-same marble were<br/> The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,<br/> Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.<br/></p>
			<p>People appeared in front, and all of them<br/> In seven choirs divided, of two senses<br/> Made one say “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”<br/></p>
			<p>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,<br/> Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose<br/> Were in the yes and no discordant made.<br/></p>
			<p>Preceded there the vessel benedight,<br/> Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<br/> And more and less than King was he in this.<br/></p>
			<p>Opposite, represented at the window<br/> Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<br/> Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.<br/></p>
			<p>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,<br/> To examine near at hand another story,<br/> Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.<br/></p>
			<p>There the high glory of the Roman Prince<br/> Was chronicled, whose great beneficence<br/> Moved Gregory to his great victory;<br/></p>
			<p>’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;<br/> And a poor widow at his bridle stood,<br/> In attitude of weeping and of grief.<br/></p>
			<p>Around about him seemed it thronged and full<br/> Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold<br/> Above them visibly in the wind were moving.<br/></p>
			<p>The wretched woman in the midst of these<br/> Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,<br/> For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to answer her: “Now wait until<br/> I shall return.” And she: “My Lord,” like one<br/> In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not<br/></p>
			<p>Return?” And he: “Who shall be where I am<br/> Will give it thee.” And she: “Good deed of others<br/> What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me<br/> That I discharge my duty ere I move;<br/> Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”<br/></p>
			<p>He who on no new thing has ever looked<br/> Was the creator of this visible language,<br/> Novel to us, for here it is not found.<br/></p>
			<p>While I delighted me in contemplating<br/> The images of such humility,<br/> And dear to look on for their Maker’s sake,<br/></p>
			<p>“Behold, upon this side, but rare they make<br/> Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;<br/> These will direct us to the lofty stairs.”<br/></p>
			<p>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent<br/> To see new things, of which they curious are,<br/> In turning round towards him were not slow.<br/></p>
			<p>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve<br/> From thy good purposes, because thou hearest<br/> How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;<br/></p>
			<p>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,<br/> Think of what follows; think that at the worst<br/> It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.<br/></p>
			<p>“Master,” began I, “that which I behold<br/> Moving towards us seems to me not persons,<br/> And what I know not, so in sight I waver.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “The grievous quality<br/> Of this their torment bows them so to earth,<br/> That my own eyes at first contended with it;<br/></p>
			<p>But look there fixedly, and disentangle<br/> By sight what cometh underneath those stones;<br/> Already canst thou see how each is stricken.”<br/></p>
			<p>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!<br/> Who, in the vision of the mind infirm<br/> Confidence have in your backsliding steps,<br/></p>
			<p>Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,<br/> Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly<br/> That flieth unto judgment without screen?<br/></p>
			<p>Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?<br/> Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,<br/> Even as the worm in whom formation fails!<br/></p>
			<p>As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,<br/> In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure<br/> Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,<br/></p>
			<p>Which makes of the unreal real anguish<br/> Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus<br/> Beheld I those, when I had ta’en good heed.<br/></p>
			<p>True is it, they were more or less bent down,<br/> According as they more or less were laden;<br/> And he who had most patience in his looks<br/></p>
			<p>Weeping did seem to say, “I can no more!”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span></p>
			<p>“Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,<br/> Not circumscribed, but from the greater love<br/> Thou bearest to the first effects on high,<br/></p>
			<p>Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence<br/> By every creature, as befitting is<br/> To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.<br/></p>
			<p>Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,<br/> For unto it we cannot of ourselves,<br/> If it come not, with all our intellect.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as thine own Angels of their will<br/> Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,<br/> So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.<br/></p>
			<p>Give unto us this day our daily manna,<br/> Withouten which in this rough wilderness<br/> Backward goes he who toils most to advance.<br/></p>
			<p>And even as we the trespass we have suffered<br/> Pardon in one another, pardon thou<br/> Benignly, and regard not our desert.<br/></p>
			<p>Our virtue, which is easily o’ercome,<br/> Put not to proof with the old Adversary,<br/> But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.<br/></p>
			<p>This last petition verily, dear Lord,<br/> Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,<br/> But for their sake who have remained behind us.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus for themselves and us good furtherance<br/> Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight<br/> Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,<br/></p>
			<p>Unequally in anguish round and round<br/> And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,<br/> Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.<br/></p>
			<p>If there good words are always said for us,<br/> What may not here be said and done for them,<br/> By those who have a good root to their will?<br/></p>
			<p>Well may we help them wash away the marks<br/> That hence they carried, so that clean and light<br/> They may ascend unto the starry wheels!<br/></p>
			<p>“Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden<br/> Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,<br/> That shall uplift you after your desire,<br/></p>
			<p>Show us on which hand tow’rd the stairs the way<br/> Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,<br/> Point us out that which least abruptly falls;<br/></p>
			<p>For he who cometh with me, through the burden<br/> Of Adam’s flesh wherewith he is invested,<br/> Against his will is chary of his climbing.”<br/></p>
			<p>The words of theirs which they returned to those<br/> That he whom I was following had spoken,<br/> It was not manifest from whom they came,<br/></p>
			<p>But it was said: “To the right hand come with us<br/> Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass<br/> Possible for living person to ascend.<br/></p>
			<p>And were I not impeded by the stone,<br/> Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,<br/> Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,<br/></p>
			<p>Him, who still lives and does not name himself,<br/> Would I regard, to see if I may know him<br/> And make him piteous unto this burden.<br/></p>
			<p>A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;<br/> Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;<br/> I know not if his name were ever with you.<br/></p>
			<p>The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry<br/> Of my progenitors so arrogant made me<br/> That, thinking not upon the common mother,<br/></p>
			<p>All men I held in scorn to such extent<br/> I died therefor, as know the Sienese,<br/> And every child in Campagnatico.<br/></p>
			<p>I am Omberto; and not to me alone<br/> Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin<br/> Has with it dragged into adversity.<br/></p>
			<p>And here must I this burden bear for it<br/> Till God be satisfied, since I did not<br/> Among the living, here among the dead.”<br/></p>
			<p>Listening I downward bent my countenance;<br/> And one of them, not this one who was speaking,<br/> Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,<br/></p>
			<p>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,<br/> Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed<br/> On me, who all bowed down was going with them.<br/></p>
			<p>“O,” asked I him, “art thou not Oderisi,<br/> Agobbio’s honour, and honour of that art<br/> Which is in Paris called illuminating?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Brother,” said he, “more laughing are the leaves<br/> Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;<br/> All his the honour now, and mine in part.<br/></p>
			<p>In sooth I had not been so courteous<br/> While I was living, for the great desire<br/> Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.<br/></p>
			<p>Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;<br/> And yet I should not be here, were it not<br/> That, having power to sin, I turned to God.<br/></p>
			<p>O thou vain glory of the human powers,<br/> How little green upon thy summit lingers,<br/> If’t be not followed by an age of grossness!<br/></p>
			<p>In painting Cimabue thought that he<br/> Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,<br/> So that the other’s fame is growing dim.<br/></p>
			<p>So has one Guido from the other taken<br/> The glory of our tongue, and he perchance<br/> Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.<br/></p>
			<p>Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath<br/> Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,<br/> And changes name, because it changes side.<br/></p>
			<p>What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off<br/> From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead<br/> Before thou left the ‘pappo’ and the ‘dindi,’<br/></p>
			<p>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter<br/> Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye<br/> Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.<br/></p>
			<p>With him, who takes so little of the road<br/> In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;<br/> And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,<br/></p>
			<p>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<br/> The Florentine delirium, that superb<br/> Was at that day as now ’tis prostitute.<br/></p>
			<p>Your reputation is the colour of grass<br/> Which comes and goes, and that discolours it<br/> By which it issues green from out the earth.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “Thy true speech fills my heart with good<br/> Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;<br/> But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”<br/></p>
			<p>“That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,<br/> And he is here because he had presumed<br/> To bring Siena all into his hands.<br/></p>
			<p>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest<br/> E’er since he died; such money renders back<br/> In payment he who is on earth too daring.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “If every spirit who awaits<br/> The verge of life before that he repent,<br/> Remains below there and ascends not hither,<br/></p>
			<p>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)<br/> Until as much time as he lived be passed,<br/> How was the coming granted him in largess?”<br/></p>
			<p>“When he in greatest splendour lived,” said he,<br/> “Freely upon the Campo of Siena,<br/> All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;<br/></p>
			<p>And there to draw his friend from the duress<br/> Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,<br/> He brought himself to tremble in each vein.<br/></p>
			<p>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;<br/> Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours<br/> Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.<br/></p>
			<p>This action has released him from those confines.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span></p>
			<p>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,<br/> I with that heavy-laden soul went on,<br/> As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;<br/></p>
			<p>But when he said, “Leave him, and onward pass,<br/> For here ’tis good that with the sail and oars,<br/> As much as may be, each push on his barque;”<br/></p>
			<p>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed<br/> My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts<br/> Remained within me downcast and abashed.<br/></p>
			<p>I had moved on, and followed willingly<br/> The footsteps of my Master, and we both<br/> Already showed how light of foot we were,<br/></p>
			<p>When unto me he said: “Cast down thine eyes;<br/> ’Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,<br/> To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.”<br/></p>
			<p>As, that some memory may exist of them,<br/> Above the buried dead their tombs in earth<br/> Bear sculptured on them what they were before;<br/></p>
			<p>Whence often there we weep for them afresh,<br/> From pricking of remembrance, which alone<br/> To the compassionate doth set its spur;<br/></p>
			<p>So saw I there, but of a better semblance<br/> In point of artifice, with figures covered<br/> Whate’er as pathway from the mount projects.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw that one who was created noble<br/> More than all other creatures, down from heaven<br/> Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.<br/></p>

			<p>I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,<br/> As if bewildered, looking at the people<br/> Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.<br/></p>
			<p>O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes<br/> Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,<br/> Between thy seven and seven children slain!<br/></p>
			<p>O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword<br/> Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,<br/> That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!<br/></p>
			<p>O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld<br/> E’en then half spider, sad upon the shreds<br/> Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!<br/></p>
			<p>O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten<br/> Thine image there; but full of consternation<br/> A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!<br/></p>
			<p>Displayed moreo’er the adamantine pavement<br/> How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon<br/> Costly appear the luckless ornament;<br/></p>
			<p>Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves<br/> Upon Sennacherib within the temple,<br/> And how, he being dead, they left him there;<br/></p>
			<p>Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage<br/> That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<br/> “Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!”<br/></p>
			<p>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians<br/> After that Holofernes had been slain,<br/> And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;<br/> O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,<br/> Displayed the image that is there discerned!<br/></p>
			<p>Whoe’er of pencil master was or stile,<br/> That could portray the shades and traits which there<br/> Would cause each subtile genius to admire?<br/></p>
			<p>Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;<br/> Better than I saw not who saw the truth,<br/> All that I trod upon while bowed I went.<br/></p>
			<p>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,<br/> Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces<br/> So that ye may behold your evil ways!<br/></p>
			<p>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,<br/> And far more spent the circuit of the sun,<br/> Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,<br/></p>
			<p>When he, who ever watchful in advance<br/> Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,<br/> ’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.<br/></p>
			<p>Lo there an Angel who is making haste<br/> To come towards us; lo, returning is<br/> From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.<br/></p>
			<p>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,<br/> So that he may delight to speed us upward;<br/> Think that this day will never dawn again.”<br/></p>
			<p>I was familiar with his admonition<br/> Ever to lose no time; so on this theme<br/> He could not unto me speak covertly.<br/></p>
			<p>Towards us came the being beautiful<br/> Vested in white, and in his countenance<br/> Such as appears the tremulous morning star.<br/></p>
			<p>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;<br/> “Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,<br/> And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”<br/></p>
			<p>At this announcement few are they who come!<br/> O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br/> Why fall ye thus before a little wind?<br/></p>
			<p>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/> There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/> Then a safe passage promised unto me.<br/></p>
			<p>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/> Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/> O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<br/></p>
			<p>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/> By stairways that were made there in the age<br/> When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<br/></p>
			<p>E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/> Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/> But on this, side and that the high rock graze.<br/></p>
			<p>As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/> “Beati pauperes spiritu,” voices<br/> Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.<br/></p>
			<p>Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/> From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/> One enters, and below with wild laments.<br/></p>
			<p>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/> And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/> Than on the plain it had appeared before.<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/> Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/> Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”<br/></p>
			<p>He answered: “When the P’s which have remained<br/> Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/> Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,<br/></p>
			<p>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/> That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/> But urging up will be to them delight.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then did I even as they do who are going<br/> With something on the head to them unknown,<br/> Unless the signs of others make them doubt,<br/></p>
			<p>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/> And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/> Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;<br/></p>
			<p>And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/> I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/> Upon my temples he who bore the keys;<br/></p>
			<p>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span></p>
			<p>We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/> Where for the second time is cut away<br/> The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.<br/></p>
			<p>There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/> The hill all round about, as does the first,<br/> Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.<br/></p>
			<p>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br/> So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br/> With but the livid colour of the stone.<br/></p>
			<p>“If to inquire we wait for people here,”<br/> The Poet said, “I fear that peradventure<br/> Too much delay will our election have.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/> Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/> And turned the left part of himself about.<br/></p>
			<p>“O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/> Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,”<br/> Said he, “as one within here should be led.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/> If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/> Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!”<br/></p>
			<p>As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/> So much already there had we advanced<br/> In little time, by dint of ready will;<br/></p>
			<p>And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/> They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/> Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,<br/></p>
			<p>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/> “Vinum non habent,” said in accents loud,<br/> And went reiterating it behind us.<br/></p>
			<p>And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/> Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/> “I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.<br/></p>
			<p>“O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”<br/> And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/> Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”<br/></p>
			<p>And the good Master said: “This circle scourges<br/> The sin of envy, and on that account<br/> Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<br/></p>
			<p>The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/> I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/> Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.<br/></p>
			<p>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/> And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/> And each one close against the cliff is seated.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/> I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/> Not from the colour of the stone diverse.<br/></p>
			<p>And when we were a little farther onward,<br/> I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”<br/> A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”<br/></p>
			<p>I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/> A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/> With pity at what afterward I saw.<br/></p>
			<p>For when I had approached so near to them<br/> That manifest to me their acts became,<br/> Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.<br/></p>
			<p>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/> And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/> And all of them were by the bank sustained.<br/></p>
			<p>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/> Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/> And one upon another leans his head,<br/></p>
			<p>So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/> Not only at the accent of their words,<br/> But at their aspect, which no less implores.<br/></p>
			<p>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/> So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/> Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;<br/></p>
			<p>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/> And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/> Is done, because it will not quiet stay.<br/></p>
			<p>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/> Seeing the others without being seen;<br/> Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.<br/></p>
			<p>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/> And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/> But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”<br/></p>
			<p>I had Virgilius upon that side<br/> Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/> Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;<br/></p>
			<p>Upon the other side of me I had<br/> The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/> Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.<br/></p>
			<p>To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”<br/> Began I, “of beholding the high light,<br/> Which your desire has solely in its care,<br/></p>
			<p>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br/> Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br/> Through them descend the river of the mind,<br/></p>
			<p>Tell me, for dear ’twill be to me and gracious,<br/> If any soul among you here is Latian,<br/> And ’twill perchance be good for him I learn it.”<br/></p>
			<p>“O brother mine, each one is citizen<br/> Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br/> Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.”<br/></p>
			<p>By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/> A little farther on than where I stood,<br/> Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.<br/></p>
			<p>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/> In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/> Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.<br/></p>
			<p>“Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,<br/> If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/> Make thyself known to me by place or name.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Sienese was I,” it replied, “and with<br/> The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/> Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.<br/></p>
			<p>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/> Was called, and I was at another’s harm<br/> More happy far than at my own good fortune.<br/></p>
			<p>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br/> Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br/> The arc already of my years descending,<br/></p>
			<p>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/> Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br/> And I was praying God for what he willed.<br/></p>
			<p>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br/> Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/> A joy received unequalled by all others;<br/></p>
			<p>So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/> Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’<br/> As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.<br/></p>
			<p>Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/> Of my existence, and as yet would not<br/> My debt have been by penitence discharged,<br/></p>
			<p>Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br/> Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br/> Who out of charity was grieved for me.<br/></p>
			<p>But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/> Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/> As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,<br/> But for short space; for small is the offence<br/> Committed by their being turned with envy.<br/></p>
			<p>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/> My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/> For even now the load down there weighs on me.”<br/></p>
			<p>And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us<br/> Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”<br/> And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;<br/></p>
			<p>And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/> Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/> O’er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.”<br/></p>
			<p>“O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”<br/> She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/> Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.<br/></p>
			<p>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/> If e’er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/> Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.<br/></p>
			<p>Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/> Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br/> More hope than in discovering the Diana;<br/></p>
			<p>But there still more the admirals will lose.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span></p>
			<p>“Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<br/> Or ever Death has given him power of flight,<br/> And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”<br/></p>
			<p>“I know not who, but know he’s not alone;<br/> Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br/> And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,<br/> Discourse about me there on the right hand;<br/> Then held supine their faces to address me.<br/></p>
			<p>And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still<br/> Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,<br/> For charity console us, and declare<br/></p>
			<p>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us<br/> As much to marvel at this grace of thine<br/> As must a thing that never yet has been.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders<br/> A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<br/> And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;<br/></p>
			<p>From thereupon do I this body bring.<br/> To tell you who I am were speech in vain,<br/> Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”<br/></p>
			<p>“If well thy meaning I can penetrate<br/> With intellect of mine,” then answered me<br/> He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”<br/></p>
			<p>And said the other to him: “Why concealed<br/> This one the appellation of that river,<br/> Even as a man doth of things horrible?”<br/></p>
			<p>And thus the shade that questioned was of this<br/> Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly<br/> ’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;<br/></p>
			<p>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant<br/> The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<br/> That in few places it that mark surpasses)<br/></p>
			<p>To where it yields itself in restoration<br/> Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,<br/> Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,<br/></p>
			<p>Virtue is like an enemy avoided<br/> By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune<br/> Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;<br/></p>
			<p>On which account have so transformed their nature<br/> The dwellers in that miserable valley,<br/> It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.<br/></p>
			<p>‘Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<br/> Than other food for human use created,<br/> It first directeth its impoverished way.<br/></p>
			<p>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<br/> More snarling than their puissance demands,<br/> And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.<br/></p>
			<p>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,<br/> The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<br/> This maledict and misadventurous ditch.<br/></p>
			<p>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,<br/> It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<br/> They fear no cunning that may master them.<br/></p>
			<p>Nor will I cease because another hears me;<br/> And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him<br/> Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.<br/></p>
			<p>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<br/> A hunter of those wolves upon the bank<br/> Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.<br/></p>
			<p>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;<br/> Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;<br/> Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.<br/></p>
			<p>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<br/> He leaves it such, a thousand years from now<br/> In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”<br/></p>
			<p>As at the announcement of impending ills<br/> The face of him who listens is disturbed,<br/> From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;<br/></p>
			<p>So I beheld that other soul, which stood<br/> Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,<br/> When it had gathered to itself the word.<br/></p>
			<p>The speech of one and aspect of the other<br/> Had me desirous made to know their names,<br/> And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,<br/></p>
			<p>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me<br/> Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me<br/> To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;<br/></p>
			<p>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth<br/> Such grace of his, I’ll not be chary with thee;<br/> Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.<br/></p>
			<p>My blood was so with envy set on fire,<br/> That if I had beheld a man make merry,<br/> Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o’er with pallor.<br/></p>
			<p>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!<br/> O human race! why dost thou set thy heart<br/> Where interdict of partnership must be?<br/></p>
			<p>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour<br/> Of the house of Calboli, where no one since<br/> Has made himself the heir of his desert.<br/></p>
			<p>And not alone his blood is made devoid,<br/> ’Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,<br/> Of good required for truth and for diversion;<br/></p>
			<p>For all within these boundaries is full<br/> Of venomous roots, so that too tardily<br/> By cultivation now would they diminish.<br/></p>
			<p>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,<br/> Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,<br/> O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?<br/></p>
			<p>When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?<br/> When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,<br/> The noble scion of ignoble seed?<br/></p>
			<p>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,<br/> When I remember, with Guido da Prata,<br/> Ugolin d’ Azzo, who was living with us,<br/></p>
			<p>Frederick Tignoso and his company,<br/> The house of Traversara, and th’ Anastagi,<br/> And one race and the other is extinct;<br/></p>
			<p>The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease<br/> That filled our souls with love and courtesy,<br/> There where the hearts have so malicious grown!<br/></p>
			<p>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,<br/> Seeing that all thy family is gone,<br/> And many people, not to be corrupted?<br/></p>
			<p>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting<br/> And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,<br/> In taking trouble to beget such Counts.<br/></p>
			<p>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil<br/> Shall have departed; but not therefore pure<br/> Will testimony of them e’er remain.<br/></p>
			<p>O Ugolin de’ Fantoli, secure<br/> Thy name is, since no longer is awaited<br/> One who, degenerating, can obscure it!<br/></p>
			<p>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me<br/> To weep far better than it does to speak,<br/> So much has our discourse my mind distressed.”<br/></p>
			<p>We were aware that those beloved souls<br/> Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,<br/> They made us of our pathway confident.<br/></p>
			<p>When we became alone by going onward,<br/> Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared<br/> A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:<br/></p>
			<p>“Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!”<br/> And fled as the reverberation dies<br/> If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,<br/> Behold another, with so great a crash,<br/> That it resembled thunderings following fast:<br/></p>
			<p>“I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!”<br/> And then, to press myself close to the Poet,<br/> I backward, and not forward, took a step.<br/></p>
			<p>Already on all sides the air was quiet;<br/> And said he to me: “That was the hard curb<br/> That ought to hold a man within his bounds;<br/></p>
			<p>But you take in the bait so that the hook<br/> Of the old Adversary draws you to him,<br/> And hence availeth little curb or call.<br/></p>
			<p>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,<br/> Displaying to you their eternal beauties,<br/> And still your eye is looking on the ground;<br/></p>
			<p>Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span></p>
			<p>As much as ’twixt the close of the third hour<br/> And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere<br/> Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,<br/></p>
			<p>So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br/> Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br/> There it was evening, and ’twas midnight here;<br/></p>
			<p>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br/> Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br/> That straight towards the west we now were going<br/></p>
			<p>When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br/> Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br/> And stupor were to me the things unknown,<br/></p>
			<p>Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br/> I raised my hands, and made myself the visor<br/> Which the excessive glare diminishes.<br/></p>
			<p>As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br/> The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,<br/> Ascending upward in the selfsame measure<br/></p>
			<p>That it descends, and deviates as far<br/> From falling of a stone in line direct,<br/> (As demonstrate experiment and art,)<br/></p>
			<p>So it appeared to me that by a light<br/> Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br/> On which account my sight was swift to flee.<br/></p>
			<p>“What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br/> So fully screen my sight that it avail me,”<br/> Said I, “and seems towards us to be moving?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet<br/> The family of heaven,” he answered me;<br/> “An angel ’tis, who comes to invite us upward.<br/></p>
			<p>Soon will it be, that to behold these things<br/> Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee<br/> As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.”<br/></p>
			<p>When we had reached the Angel benedight,<br/> With joyful voice he said: “Here enter in<br/> To stairway far less steep than are the others.”<br/></p>
			<p>We mounting were, already thence departed,<br/> And “Beati misericordes” was<br/> Behind us sung, “Rejoice, thou that o’ercomest!”<br/></p>
			<p>My Master and myself, we two alone<br/> Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br/> Some profit to acquire from words of his;<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br/> “What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br/> Mentioning interdict and partnership?”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence he to me: “Of his own greatest failing<br/> He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not<br/> If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.<br/></p>
			<p>Because are thither pointed your desires<br/> Where by companionship each share is lessened,<br/> Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.<br/></p>
			<p>But if the love of the supernal sphere<br/> Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br/> There would not be that fear within your breast;<br/></p>
			<p>For there, as much the more as one says ‘Our,’<br/> So much the more of good each one possesses,<br/> And more of charity in that cloister burns.”<br/></p>
			<p>“I am more hungering to be satisfied,”<br/> I said, “than if I had before been silent,<br/> And more of doubt within my mind I gather.<br/></p>
			<p>How can it be, that boon distributed<br/> The more possessors can more wealthy make<br/> Therein, than if by few it be possessed?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “Because thou fixest still<br/> Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/> Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.<br/></p>
			<p>That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/> Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/> As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.<br/></p>
			<p>So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/> So that as far as charity extends,<br/> O’er it increases the eternal valour.<br/></p>
			<p>And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/> More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/> And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.<br/></p>
			<p>And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/> Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/> Take from thee this and every other longing.<br/></p>
			<p>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<br/> As are the two already, the five wounds<br/> That close themselves again by being painful.”<br/></p>
			<p>Even as I wished to say, “Thou dost appease me,”<br/> I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/> So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.<br/></p>
			<p>There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/> Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/> And in a temple many persons saw;<br/></p>
			<p>And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br/> Behaviour of a mother, saying: “Son,<br/> Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?<br/></p>
			<p>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/> Were seeking for thee;”⁠—and as here she ceased,<br/> That which appeared at first had disappeared.<br/></p>
			<p>Then I beheld another with those waters<br/> Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/> From great disdain of others it is born,<br/></p>
			<p>And saying: “If of that city thou art lord,<br/> For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br/> And whence doth every science scintillate,<br/></p>
			<p>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/> That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;”<br/> And the lord seemed to me benign and mild<br/></p>
			<p>To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/> “What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/> If he who loves us be by us condemned?”<br/></p>
			<p>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/> With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/> Still crying to each other, “Kill him! kill him!”<br/></p>
			<p>And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/> That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/> But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,<br/></p>
			<p>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/> That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/> With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.<br/></p>
			<p>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/> To things external to it which are true,<br/> Did I my not false errors recognize.<br/></p>
			<p>My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/> Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/> Exclaimed: “What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?<br/></p>
			<p>But hast been coming more than half a league<br/> Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/> In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?”<br/></p>
			<p>“O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/> I’ll tell thee,” said I, “what appeared to me,<br/> When thus from me my legs were ta’en away.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he: “If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/> Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br/> Thy cogitations, howsoever small.<br/></p>
			<p>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/> To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/> Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.<br/></p>
			<p>I did not ask, ‘What ails thee?’ as he does<br/> Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br/> When of the soul bereft the body lies,<br/></p>
			<p>But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/> Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/> To use their wakefulness when it returns.”<br/></p>
			<p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/> Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/> Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/> In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/> Nor was there place to hide one’s self therefrom.<br/></p>
			<p>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>

			<p>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br/> Of every planet under a poor sky,<br/> As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,<br/></p>
			<p>Ne’er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br/> As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br/> Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;<br/></p>
			<p>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;<br/> Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,<br/> Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.<br/></p>
			<p>E’en as a blind man goes behind his guide,<br/> Lest he should wander, or should strike against<br/> Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,<br/></p>
			<p>So went I through the bitter and foul air,<br/> Listening unto my Leader, who said only,<br/> “Look that from me thou be not separated.”<br/></p>
			<p>Voices I heard, and every one appeared<br/> To supplicate for peace and misericord<br/> The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.<br/></p>
			<p>Still “Agnus Dei” their exordium was;<br/> One word there was in all, and metre one,<br/> So that all harmony appeared among them.<br/></p>
			<p>“Master,” I said, “are spirits those I hear?”<br/> And he to me: “Thou apprehendest truly,<br/> And they the knot of anger go unloosing.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/> And art discoursing of us even as though<br/> Thou didst by calends still divide the time?”<br/></p>
			<p>After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br/> Whereon my Master said: “Do thou reply,<br/> And ask if on this side the way go upward.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br/> To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br/> Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,”<br/> He answered; “and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/> Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thereon began I: “With that swathing band<br/> Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/> And hither came I through the infernal anguish.<br/></p>
			<p>And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/> So that he wills that I behold his court<br/> By method wholly out of modern usage,<br/></p>
			<p>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/> But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br/> Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br/> The world I knew, and loved that excellence,<br/> At which has each one now unbent his bow.<br/></p>
			<p>For mounting upward, thou art going right.”<br/> Thus he made answer, and subjoined: “I pray thee<br/> To pray for me when thou shalt be above.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him: “My faith I pledge to thee<br/> To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br/> Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.<br/></p>
			<p>First it was simple, and is now made double<br/> By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br/> Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.<br/></p>
			<p>The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br/> By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br/> And with iniquity is big and covered;<br/></p>
			<p>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br/> That I may see it, and to others show it;<br/> For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.”<br/></p>
			<p>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br/> He first sent forth, and then began he: “Brother,<br/> The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!<br/></p>
			<p>Ye who are living every cause refer<br/> Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/> They of necessity moved with themselves.<br/></p>
			<p>If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/> Free will, nor any justice would there be<br/> In having joy for good, or grief for evil.<br/></p>
			<p>The heavens your movements do initiate,<br/> I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br/> Light has been given you for good and evil,<br/></p>
			<p>And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br/> In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/> Afterwards conquers all, if well ’tis nurtured.<br/></p>
			<p>To greater force and to a better nature,<br/> Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/> The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/> In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/> And I therein will now be thy true spy.<br/></p>
			<p>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br/> Before it is, like to a little girl<br/> Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,<br/></p>
			<p>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,<br/> Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,<br/> Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.<br/></p>
			<p>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/> Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/> If guide or rein turn not aside its love.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/> Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/> Of the true city should discern the tower.<br/></p>
			<p>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/> No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/> Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;<br/></p>
			<p>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/> Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br/> Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.<br/></p>
			<p>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br/> The cause is that has made the world depraved,<br/> And not that nature is corrupt in you.<br/></p>
			<p>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was<br/> Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<br/> Of God and of the world, made manifest.<br/></p>
			<p>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier<br/> The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br/> That by main force one with the other go,<br/></p>
			<p>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br/> If thou believe not, think upon the grain,<br/> For by its seed each herb is recognized.<br/></p>
			<p>In the land laved by Po and Adige,<br/> Valour and courtesy used to be found,<br/> Before that Frederick had his controversy;<br/></p>
			<p>Now in security can pass that way<br/> Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,<br/> From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.<br/></p>
			<p>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids<br/> The ancient age the new, and late they deem it<br/> That God restore them to the better life:<br/></p>
			<p>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<br/> And Guido da Castel, who better named is,<br/> In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:<br/></p>
			<p>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,<br/> Confounding in itself two governments,<br/> Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.”<br/></p>
			<p>“O Marco mine,” I said, “thou reasonest well;<br/> And now discern I why the sons of Levi<br/> Have been excluded from the heritage.<br/></p>
			<p>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample<br/> Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained<br/> In reprobation of the barbarous age?”<br/></p>
			<p>“Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,”<br/> He answered me; “for speaking Tuscan to me,<br/> It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.<br/></p>
			<p>By other surname do I know him not,<br/> Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<br/> May God be with you, for I come no farther.<br/></p>
			<p>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,<br/> Already whitening; and I must depart⁠—<br/> Yonder the Angel is⁠—ere he appear.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVII</span></p>
			<p>Remember, Reader, if e’er in the Alps<br/> A mist o’ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<br/> Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,<br/></p>
			<p>How, when the vapours humid and condensed<br/> Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere<br/> Of the sun feebly enters in among them,<br/></p>
			<p>And thy imagination will be swift<br/> In coming to perceive how I re-saw<br/> The sun at first, that was already setting.<br/></p>
			<p>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master<br/> Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud<br/> To rays already dead on the low shores.<br/></p>
			<p>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us<br/> So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,<br/> Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,<br/></p>
			<p>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?<br/> Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,<br/> By self, or by a will that downward guides it.<br/></p>
			<p>Of her impiety, who changed her form<br/> Into the bird that most delights in singing,<br/> In my imagining appeared the trace;<br/></p>
			<p>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn<br/> Within itself, that from without there came<br/> Nothing that then might be received by it.<br/></p>
			<p>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy<br/> One crucified, disdainful and ferocious<br/> In countenance, and even thus was dying.<br/></p>
			<p>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,<br/> Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,<br/> Who was in word and action so entire.<br/></p>
			<p>And even as this image burst asunder<br/> Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br/> In which the water it was made of fails,<br/></p>
			<p>There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br/> Bitterly weeping, and she said: “O queen,<br/> Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?<br/></p>
			<p>Thou’st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br/> Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br/> Mother, at thine ere at another’s ruin.”<br/></p>
			<p>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br/> New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br/> And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,<br/></p>
			<p>So this imagining of mine fell down<br/> As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br/> Greater by far than what is in our wont.<br/></p>
			<p>I turned me round to see where I might be,<br/> When said a voice, “Here is the passage up;”<br/> Which from all other purposes removed me,<br/></p>
			<p>And made my wish so full of eagerness<br/> To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br/> It never rests till meeting face to face;<br/></p>
			<p>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br/> And in its own excess its figure veils,<br/> Even so my power was insufficient here.<br/></p>
			<p>“This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br/> Of going up directs us without asking,<br/> And who with his own light himself conceals.<br/></p>
			<p>He does with us as man doth with himself;<br/> For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br/> Malignly leans already tow’rds denial.<br/></p>
			<p>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br/> Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br/> For then we could not till the day return.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br/> Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br/> And I, as soon as the first step I reached,<br/></p>
			<p>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br/> And fanning in the face, and saying, “ ‘Beati<br/> Pacifici,’ who are without ill anger.”<br/></p>
			<p>Already over us were so uplifted<br/> The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br/> That upon many sides the stars appeared.<br/></p>
			<p>“O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?”<br/> I said within myself; for I perceived<br/> The vigour of my legs was put in truce.<br/></p>
			<p>We at the point were where no more ascends<br/> The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br/> Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;<br/></p>
			<p>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br/> Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br/> Then to my Master turned me round and said:<br/></p>
			<p>“Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br/> Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br/> Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “The love of good, remiss<br/> In what it should have done, is here restored;<br/> Here plied again the ill-belated oar;<br/></p>
			<p>But still more openly to understand,<br/> Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/> Some profitable fruit from our delay.<br/></p>
			<p>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/> Son,” he began, “was destitute of love<br/> Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.<br/></p>
			<p>The natural was ever without error;<br/> But err the other may by evil object,<br/> Or by too much, or by too little vigour.<br/></p>
			<p>While in the first it well directed is,<br/> And in the second moderates itself,<br/> It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;<br/></p>
			<p>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/> Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/> ’Gainst the Creator works his own creation.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/> The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br/> And every act that merits punishment.<br/></p>
			<p>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/> Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/> From their own hatred all things are secure;<br/></p>
			<p>And since we cannot think of any being<br/> Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/> Of hating Him is all desire cut off.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/> The evil that one loves is of one’s neighbour,<br/> And this is born in three modes in your clay.<br/></p>
			<p>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br/> Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br/> That from his greatness he may be cast down;<br/></p>
			<p>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br/> Fear they may lose because another rises,<br/> Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;<br/></p>
			<p>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br/> So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br/> And such must needs shape out another’s harm.<br/></p>
			<p>This threefold love is wept for down below;<br/> Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br/> That runneth after good with measure faulty.<br/></p>
			<p>Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/> Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/> Therefore to overtake it each one strives.<br/></p>
			<p>If languid love to look on this attract you,<br/> Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br/> After just penitence, torments you for it.<br/></p>
			<p>There’s other good that does not make man happy;<br/> ’Tis not felicity, ’tis not the good<br/> Essence, of every good the fruit and root.<br/></p>
			<p>The love that yields itself too much to this<br/> Above us is lamented in three circles;<br/> But how tripartite it may be described,<br/></p>
			<p>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span></p>
			<p>An end had put unto his reasoning<br/> The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking<br/> Into my face, if I appeared content;<br/></p>
			<p>And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,<br/> Without was mute, and said within: “Perchance<br/> The too much questioning I make annoys him.”<br/></p>
			<p>But that true Father, who had comprehended<br/> The timid wish, that opened not itself,<br/> By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I: “My sight is, Master, vivified<br/> So in thy light, that clearly I discern<br/> Whate’er thy speech importeth or describes.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,<br/> To teach me love, to which thou dost refer<br/> Every good action and its contrary.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Direct,” he said, “towards me the keen eyes<br/> Of intellect, and clear will be to thee<br/> The error of the blind, who would be leaders.<br/></p>
			<p>The soul, which is created apt to love,<br/> Is mobile unto everything that pleases,<br/> Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.<br/></p>
			<p>Your apprehension from some real thing<br/> An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br/> So that it makes the soul turn unto it.<br/></p>
			<p>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br/> Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br/> Which is by pleasure bound in you anew<br/></p>
			<p>Then even as the fire doth upward move<br/> By its own form, which to ascend is born,<br/> Where longest in its matter it endures,<br/></p>
			<p>So comes the captive soul into desire,<br/> Which is a motion spiritual, and ne’er rests<br/> Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.<br/></p>
			<p>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden<br/> The truth is from those people, who aver<br/> All love is in itself a laudable thing;<br/></p>
			<p>Because its matter may perchance appear<br/> Aye to be good; but yet not each impression<br/> Is good, albeit good may be the wax.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,”<br/> I answered him, “have love revealed to me;<br/> But that has made me more impregned with doubt;<br/></p>
			<p>For if love from without be offered us,<br/> And with another foot the soul go not,<br/> If right or wrong she go, ’tis not her merit.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “What reason seeth here,<br/> Myself can tell thee; beyond that await<br/> For Beatrice, since ’tis a work of faith.<br/></p>
			<p>Every substantial form, that segregate<br/> From matter is, and with it is united,<br/> Specific power has in itself collected,<br/></p>
			<p>Which without act is not perceptible,<br/> Nor shows itself except by its effect,<br/> As life does in a plant by the green leaves.<br/></p>
			<p>But still, whence cometh the intelligence<br/> Of the first notions, man is ignorant,<br/> And the affection for the first allurements,<br/></p>
			<p>Which are in you as instinct in the bee<br/> To make its honey; and this first desire<br/> Merit of praise or blame containeth not.<br/></p>
			<p>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,<br/> Innate within you is the power that counsels,<br/> And it should keep the threshold of assent.<br/></p>
			<p>This is the principle, from which is taken<br/> Occasion of desert in you, according<br/> As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.<br/></p>
			<p>Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,<br/> Were of this innate liberty aware,<br/> Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.<br/></p>
			<p>Supposing, then, that from necessity<br/> Springs every love that is within you kindled,<br/> Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.<br/></p>
			<p>The noble virtue Beatrice understands<br/> By the free will; and therefore see that thou<br/> Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.”<br/></p>
			<p>The moon, belated almost unto midnight,<br/> Now made the stars appear to us more rare,<br/> Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,<br/></p>
			<p>And counter to the heavens ran through those paths<br/> Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome<br/> Sees it ’twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;<br/></p>
			<p>And that patrician shade, for whom is named<br/> Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<br/> Had laid aside the burden of my lading;<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain<br/> In answer to my questions had received,<br/> Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.<br/></p>
			<p>But taken from me was this drowsiness<br/> Suddenly by a people, that behind<br/> Our backs already had come round to us.<br/></p>
			<p>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<br/> Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,<br/> If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,<br/></p>
			<p>So they along that circle curve their step,<br/> From what I saw of those approaching us,<br/> Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.<br/></p>
			<p>Full soon they were upon us, because running<br/> Moved onward all that mighty multitude,<br/> And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,<br/></p>
			<p>“Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<br/> And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<br/> Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost<br/> By little love!” forthwith the others cried,<br/> “For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!”<br/></p>
			<p>“O folk, in whom an eager fervour now<br/> Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,<br/> Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,<br/></p>
			<p>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,<br/> Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;<br/> So tell us where the passage nearest is.”<br/></p>
			<p>These were the words of him who was my Guide;<br/> And some one of those spirits said: “Come on<br/> Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;<br/></p>
			<p>So full of longing are we to move onward,<br/> That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,<br/> If thou for churlishness our justice take.<br/></p>
			<p>I was San Zeno’s Abbot at Verona,<br/> Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<br/> Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;<br/></p>
			<p>And he has one foot in the grave already,<br/> Who shall erelong lament that monastery,<br/> And sorry be of having there had power,<br/></p>
			<p>Because his son, in his whole body sick,<br/> And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,<br/> He put into the place of its true pastor.”<br/></p>
			<p>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,<br/> He had already passed so far beyond us;<br/> But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.<br/></p>
			<p>And he who was in every need my succour<br/> Said: “Turn thee hitherward; see two of them<br/> Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.”<br/></p>
			<p>In rear of all they shouted: “Sooner were<br/> The people dead to whom the sea was opened,<br/> Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;<br/></p>
			<p>And those who the fatigue did not endure<br/> Unto the issue, with Anchises’ son,<br/> Themselves to life withouten glory offered.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then when from us so separated were<br/> Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,<br/> Within me a new thought did entrance find,<br/></p>
			<p>Whence others many and diverse were born;<br/> And so I lapsed from one into another,<br/> That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,<br/></p>
			<p>And meditation into dream transmuted.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIX</span></p>
			<p>It was the hour when the diurnal heat<br/> No more can warm the coldness of the moon,<br/> Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,<br/></p>
			<p>When geomancers their Fortuna Major<br/> See in the orient before the dawn<br/> Rise by a path that long remains not dim,<br/></p>
			<p>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<br/> Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,<br/> With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.<br/></p>
			<p>I looked at her; and as the sun restores<br/> The frigid members which the night benumbs,<br/> Even thus my gaze did render voluble<br/></p>
			<p>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter<br/> In little while, and the lost countenance<br/> As love desires it so in her did colour.<br/></p>
			<p>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,<br/> She ‘gan to sing so, that with difficulty<br/> Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.<br/></p>
			<p>“I am,” she sang, “I am the Siren sweet<br/> Who mariners amid the main unman,<br/> So full am I of pleasantness to hear.<br/></p>
			<p>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way<br/> Unto my song, and he who dwells with me<br/> Seldom departs so wholly I content him.”<br/></p>
			<p>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before<br/> Appeared a Lady saintly and alert<br/> Close at my side to put her to confusion.<br/></p>
			<p>“Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?”<br/> Sternly she said; and he was drawing near<br/> With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.<br/></p>
			<p>She seized the other and in front laid open,<br/> Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;<br/> This waked me with the stench that issued from it.<br/></p>
			<p>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:<br/> “At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;<br/> Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.”<br/></p>
			<p>I rose; and full already of high day<br/> Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,<br/> And with the new sun at our back we went.<br/></p>
			<p>Following behind him, I my forehead bore<br/> Like unto one who has it laden with thought,<br/> Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,<br/></p>
			<p>When I heard say, “Come, here the passage is,”<br/> Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,<br/> Such as we hear not in this mortal region.<br/></p>
			<p>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,<br/> Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,<br/> Between the two walls of the solid granite.<br/></p>
			<p>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,<br/> Affirming those ‘qui lugent’ to be blessed,<br/> For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.<br/></p>
			<p>“What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?”<br/> To me my Guide began to say, we both<br/> Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “With such misgiving makes me go<br/> A vision new, which bends me to itself,<br/> So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Didst thou behold,” he said, “that old enchantress,<br/> Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<br/> Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?<br/></p>
			<p>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<br/> Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls<br/> The Eternal King with revolutions vast.”<br/></p>
			<p>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,<br/> Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,<br/> Through the desire of food that draws him thither,<br/></p>
			<p>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves<br/> The rock to give a way to him who mounts,<br/> Went on to where the circling doth begin.<br/></p>
			<p>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,<br/> People I saw upon it who were weeping,<br/> Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.<br/></p>
			<p>“Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,”<br/> I heard them say with sighings so profound,<br/> That hardly could the words be understood.<br/></p>
			<p>“O ye elect of God, whose sufferings<br/> Justice and Hope both render less severe,<br/> Direct ye us towards the high ascents.”<br/></p>
			<p>“If ye are come secure from this prostration,<br/> And wish to find the way most speedily,<br/> Let your right hands be evermore outside.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered<br/> By them somewhat in front of us; whence I<br/> In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,<br/></p>
			<p>And unto my Lord’s eyes mine eyes I turned;<br/> Whence he assented with a cheerful sign<br/> To what the sight of my desire implored.<br/></p>
			<p>When of myself I could dispose at will,<br/> Above that creature did I draw myself,<br/> Whose words before had caused me to take note,<br/></p>
			<p>Saying: “O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens<br/> That without which to God we cannot turn,<br/> Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.<br/></p>
			<p>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,<br/> Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee<br/> Anything there whence living I departed.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “Wherefore our backs the heaven<br/> Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand<br/> ‘Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.’<br/></p>
			<p>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends<br/> A river beautiful, and of its name<br/> The title of my blood its summit makes.<br/></p>
			<p>A month and little more essayed I how<br/> Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,<br/> For all the other burdens seem a feather.<br/></p>
			<p>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;<br/> But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,<br/> Then I discovered life to be a lie.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,<br/> Nor farther in that life could one ascend;<br/> Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.<br/></p>
			<p>Until that time a wretched soul and parted<br/> From God was I, and wholly avaricious;<br/> Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.<br/></p>
			<p>What avarice does is here made manifest<br/> In the purgation of these souls converted,<br/> And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as our eye did not uplift itself<br/> Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,<br/> So justice here has merged it in the earth.<br/></p>
			<p>As avarice had extinguished our affection<br/> For every good, whereby was action lost,<br/> So justice here doth hold us in restraint,<br/></p>
			<p>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;<br/> And so long as it pleases the just Lord<br/> Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.”<br/></p>
			<p>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;<br/> But even as I began, and he was ‘ware,<br/> Only by listening, of my reverence,<br/></p>
			<p>“What cause,” he said, “has downward bent thee thus?”<br/> And I to him: “For your own dignity,<br/> Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,”<br/> He answered: “Err not, fellow-servant am I<br/> With thee and with the others to one power.<br/></p>
			<p>If e’er that holy, evangelic sound,<br/> Which sayeth ‘neque nubent,’ thou hast heard,<br/> Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.<br/></p>
			<p>Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,<br/> Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,<br/> With which I ripen that which thou hast said.<br/></p>
			<p>On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,<br/> Good in herself, unless indeed our house<br/> Malevolent may make her by example,<br/></p>
			<p>And she alone remains to me on earth.”</p>

			<p>Ill strives the will against a better will;<br/> Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure<br/> I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.<br/></p>
			<p>Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,<br/> Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,<br/> As on a wall close to the battlements;<br/></p>
			<p>For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop<br/> The malady which all the world pervades,<br/> On the other side too near the verge approach.<br/></p>
			<p>Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,<br/> That more than all the other beasts hast prey,<br/> Because of hunger infinitely hollow!<br/></p>
			<p>O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear<br/> To think conditions here below are changed,<br/> When will he come through whom she shall depart?<br/></p>
			<p>Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,<br/> And I attentive to the shades I heard<br/> Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;<br/></p>
			<p>And I by peradventure heard “Sweet Mary!”<br/> Uttered in front of us amid the weeping<br/> Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;<br/></p>
			<p>And in continuance: “How poor thou wast<br/> Is manifested by that hostelry<br/> Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thereafterward I heard: “O good Fabricius,<br/> Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer<br/> To the possession of great wealth with vice.”<br/></p>
			<p>So pleasurable were these words to me<br/> That I drew farther onward to have knowledge<br/> Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.<br/></p>
			<p>He furthermore was speaking of the largess<br/> Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,<br/> In order to conduct their youth to honour.<br/></p>
			<p>“O soul that dost so excellently speak,<br/> Tell me who wast thou,” said I, “and why only<br/> Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?<br/></p>
			<p>Not without recompense shall be thy word,<br/> If I return to finish the short journey<br/> Of that life which is flying to its end.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he: “I’ll tell thee, not for any comfort<br/> I may expect from earth, but that so much<br/> Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.<br/></p>
			<p>I was the root of that malignant plant<br/> Which overshadows all the Christian world,<br/> So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;<br/></p>
			<p>But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges<br/> Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;<br/> And this I pray of Him who judges all.<br/></p>
			<p>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;<br/> From me were born the Louises and Philips,<br/> By whom in later days has France been governed.<br/></p>
			<p>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<br/> What time the ancient kings had perished all,<br/> Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.<br/></p>
			<p>I found me grasping in my hands the rein<br/> Of the realm’s government, and so great power<br/> Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,<br/></p>
			<p>That to the widowed diadem promoted<br/> The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<br/> The consecrated bones of these began.<br/></p>
			<p>So long as the great dowry of Provence<br/> Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,<br/> ’Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.<br/></p>
			<p>Then it began with falsehood and with force<br/> Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<br/> Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.<br/></p>
			<p>Charles came to Italy, and for amends<br/> A victim made of Conradin, and then<br/> Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.<br/></p>
			<p>A time I see, not very distant now,<br/> Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<br/> The better to make known both him and his.<br/></p>
			<p>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance<br/> That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<br/> So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.<br/></p>
			<p>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<br/> Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself<br/> As the more light such damage he accounts.<br/></p>
			<p>The other, now gone forth, ta’en in his ship,<br/> See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her<br/> As corsairs do with other female slaves.<br/></p>
			<p>What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,<br/> Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,<br/> It careth not for its own proper flesh?<br/></p>
			<p>That less may seem the future ill and past,<br/> I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,<br/> And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.<br/></p>
			<p>I see him yet another time derided;<br/> I see renewed the vinegar and gall,<br/> And between living thieves I see him slain.<br/></p>
			<p>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<br/> This does not sate him, but without decretal<br/> He to the temple bears his sordid sails!<br/></p>
			<p>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made<br/> By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,<br/> Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?<br/></p>
			<p>What I was saying of that only bride<br/> Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee<br/> To turn towards me for some commentary,<br/></p>
			<p>So long has been ordained to all our prayers<br/> As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,<br/> Contrary sound we take instead thereof.<br/></p>
			<p>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<br/> Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide<br/> Made his insatiable desire of gold;<br/></p>
			<p>And the misery of avaricious Midas,<br/> That followed his inordinate demand,<br/> At which forevermore one needs but laugh.<br/></p>
			<p>The foolish Achan each one then records,<br/> And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath<br/> Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.<br/></p>
			<p>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<br/> We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<br/> And the whole mount in infamy encircles<br/></p>
			<p>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<br/> Here finally is cried: ‘O Crassus, tell us,<br/> For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?’<br/></p>
			<p>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,<br/> According to desire of speech, that spurs us<br/> To greater now and now to lesser pace.<br/></p>
			<p>But in the good that here by day is talked of,<br/> Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<br/> No other person lifted up his voice.”<br/></p>
			<p>From him already we departed were,<br/> And made endeavour to o’ercome the road<br/> As much as was permitted to our power,<br/></p>
			<p>When I perceived, like something that is falling,<br/> The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<br/> As seizes him who to his death is going.<br/></p>
			<p>Certes so violently shook not Delos,<br/> Before Latona made her nest therein<br/> To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.<br/></p>
			<p>Then upon all sides there began a cry,<br/> Such that the Master drew himself towards me,<br/> Saying, “Fear not, while I am guiding thee.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Gloria in excelsis Deo,” all<br/> Were saying, from what near I comprehended,<br/> Where it was possible to hear the cry.<br/></p>
			<p>We paused immovable and in suspense,<br/> Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<br/> Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.<br/></p>
			<p>Then we resumed again our holy path,<br/> Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,<br/> Already turned to their accustomed plaint.<br/></p>
			<p>No ignorance ever with so great a strife<br/> Had rendered me importunate to know,<br/> If erreth not in this my memory,<br/></p>
			<p>As meditating then I seemed to have;<br/> Nor out of haste to question did I dare,<br/> Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;<br/></p>
			<p>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXI</span></p>
			<p>The natural thirst, that ne’er is satisfied<br/> Excepting with the water for whose grace<br/> The woman of Samaria besought,<br/></p>
			<p>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me<br/> Along the encumbered path behind my Leader<br/> And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<br/> That Christ appeared to two upon the way<br/> From the sepulchral cave already risen,<br/></p>
			<p>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,<br/> Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,<br/> Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,<br/></p>
			<p>Saying, “My brothers, may God give you peace!”<br/> We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered<br/> To him the countersign thereto conforming.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereon began he: “In the blessed council,<br/> Thee may the court veracious place in peace,<br/> That me doth banish in eternal exile!”<br/></p>
			<p>“How,” said he, and the while we went with speed,<br/> “If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,<br/> Who up his stairs so far has guided you?”<br/></p>
			<p>And said my Teacher: “If thou note the marks<br/> Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces<br/> Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.<br/></p>
			<p>But because she who spinneth day and night<br/> For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,<br/> Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,<br/></p>
			<p>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,<br/> In coming upwards could not come alone,<br/> By reason that it sees not in our fashion.<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat<br/> Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him<br/> As far on as my school has power to lead.<br/></p>
			<p>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder<br/> Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together<br/> All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?”<br/></p>
			<p>In asking he so hit the very eye<br/> Of my desire, that merely with the hope<br/> My thirst became the less unsatisfied.<br/></p>
			<p>“Naught is there,” he began, “that without order<br/> May the religion of the mountain feel,<br/> Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.<br/></p>
			<p>Free is it here from every permutation;<br/> What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<br/> Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;<br/></p>
			<p>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,<br/> Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls<br/> Than the short, little stairway of three steps.<br/></p>
			<p>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,<br/> Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<br/> That often upon earth her region shifts;<br/></p>
			<p>No arid vapour any farther rises<br/> Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,<br/> Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.<br/></p>
			<p>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,<br/> But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden<br/> I know not how, up here it never trembled.<br/></p>
			<p>It trembles here, whenever any soul<br/> Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves<br/> To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.<br/></p>
			<p>Of purity the will alone gives proof,<br/> Which, being wholly free to change its convent,<br/> Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.<br/></p>
			<p>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,<br/> Which divine justice with the self-same will<br/> There was to sin, upon the torment sets.<br/></p>
			<p>And I, who have been lying in this pain<br/> Five hundred years and more, but just now felt<br/> A free volition for a better seat.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious<br/> Spirits along the mountain rendering praise<br/> Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.”<br/></p>
			<p>So said he to him; and since we enjoy<br/> As much in drinking as the thirst is great,<br/> I could not say how much it did me good.<br/></p>
			<p>And the wise Leader: “Now I see the net<br/> That snares you here, and how ye are set free,<br/> Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.<br/></p>
			<p>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;<br/> And why so many centuries thou hast here<br/> Been lying, let me gather from thy words.”<br/></p>
			<p>“In days when the good Titus, with the aid<br/> Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds<br/> Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,<br/></p>
			<p>Under the name that most endures and honours,<br/> Was I on earth,” that spirit made reply,<br/> “Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.<br/></p>
			<p>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome<br/> Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<br/> Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.<br/></p>
			<p>Statius the people name me still on earth;<br/> I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;<br/> But on the way fell with my second burden.<br/></p>
			<p>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks<br/> Of that celestial flame which heated me,<br/> Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;<br/></p>
			<p>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me<br/> A mother was, and was my nurse in song;<br/> Without this weighed I not a drachma’s weight.<br/></p>
			<p>And to have lived upon the earth what time<br/> Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<br/> More than I must ere issuing from my ban.”<br/></p>
			<p>These words towards me made Virgilius turn<br/> With looks that in their silence said, “Be silent!”<br/> But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;<br/></p>
			<p>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants<br/> Unto the passion from which each springs forth,<br/> In the most truthful least the will they follow.<br/></p>
			<p>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br/> Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br/> Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;<br/></p>
			<p>And, “As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br/> So great,” it said, “why did thy face just now<br/> Display to me the lightning of a smile?”<br/></p>
			<p>Now am I caught on this side and on that;<br/> One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,<br/> Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.<br/></p>
			<p>“Speak,” said my Master, “and be not afraid<br/> Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him<br/> What he demands with such solicitude.”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I: “Thou peradventure marvellest,<br/> O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;<br/> But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.<br/></p>
			<p>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br/> Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn<br/> To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.<br/></p>
			<p>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,<br/> Abandon it as false, and trust it was<br/> Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.”<br/></p>
			<p>Already he was stooping to embrace<br/> My Teacher’s feet; but he said to him: “Brother,<br/> Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he uprising: “Now canst thou the sum<br/> Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,<br/> When this our vanity I disremember,<br/></p>
			<p>Treating a shadow as substantial thing.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXII</span></p>
			<p>Already was the Angel left behind us,<br/> The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,<br/> Having erased one mark from off my face;<br/></p>
			<p>And those who have in justice their desire<br/> Had said to us, “Beati,” in their voices,<br/> With “sitio,” and without more ended it.<br/></p>
			<p>And I, more light than through the other passes,<br/> Went onward so, that without any labour<br/> I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;<br/></p>
			<p>When thus Virgilius began: “The love<br/> Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,<br/> Provided outwardly its flame appear.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<br/> Among us into the infernal Limbo,<br/> Who made apparent to me thy affection,<br/></p>
			<p>My kindliness towards thee was as great<br/> As ever bound one to an unseen person,<br/> So that these stairs will now seem short to me.<br/></p>
			<p>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,<br/> If too great confidence let loose the rein,<br/> And as a friend now hold discourse with me;<br/></p>
			<p>How was it possible within thy breast<br/> For avarice to find place, ‘mid so much wisdom<br/> As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?”<br/></p>
			<p>These words excited Statius at first<br/> Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:<br/> “Each word of thine is love’s dear sign to me.<br/></p>
			<p>Verily oftentimes do things appear<br/> Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,<br/> Instead of the true causes which are hidden!<br/></p>
			<p>Thy question shows me thy belief to be<br/> That I was niggard in the other life,<br/> It may be from the circle where I was;<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed<br/> Too far from me; and this extravagance<br/> Thousands of lunar periods have punished.<br/></p>
			<p>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,<br/> When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,<br/> As if indignant, unto human nature,<br/></p>
			<p>‘To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<br/> Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?’<br/> Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.<br/></p>
			<p>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide<br/> Their wings in spending, and repented me<br/> As well of that as of my other sins;<br/></p>
			<p>How many with shorn hair shall rise again<br/> Because of ignorance, which from this sin<br/> Cuts off repentance living and in death!<br/></p>
			<p>And know that the transgression which rebuts<br/> By direct opposition any sin<br/> Together with it here its verdure dries.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore if I have been among that folk<br/> Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,<br/> For its opposite has this befallen me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons<br/> Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,”<br/> The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,<br/></p>
			<p>“From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<br/> It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful<br/> That faith without which no good works suffice.<br/></p>
			<p>If this be so, what candles or what sun<br/> Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim<br/> Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to him: “Thou first directedst me<br/> Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,<br/> And first concerning God didst me enlighten.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,<br/> Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,<br/> But wary makes the persons after him,<br/></p>
			<p>When thou didst say: ‘The age renews itself,<br/> Justice returns, and man’s primeval time,<br/> And a new progeny descends from heaven.’<br/></p>
			<p>Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;<br/> But that thou better see what I design,<br/> To colour it will I extend my hand.<br/></p>
			<p>Already was the world in every part<br/> Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated<br/> By messengers of the eternal kingdom;<br/></p>
			<p>And thy assertion, spoken of above,<br/> With the new preachers was in unison;<br/> Whence I to visit them the custom took.<br/></p>
			<p>Then they became so holy in my sight,<br/> That, when Domitian persecuted them,<br/> Not without tears of mine were their laments;<br/></p>
			<p>And all the while that I on earth remained,<br/> Them I befriended, and their upright customs<br/> Made me disparage all the other sects.<br/></p>
			<p>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers<br/> Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,<br/> But out of fear was covertly a Christian,<br/></p>
			<p>For a long time professing paganism;<br/> And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<br/> To circuit round more than four centuries.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering<br/> That hid from me whatever good I speak of,<br/> While in ascending we have time to spare,<br/></p>
			<p>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<br/> Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;<br/> Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.”<br/></p>
			<p>“These, Persius and myself, and others many,”<br/> Replied my Leader, “with that Grecian are<br/> Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,<br/></p>
			<p>In the first circle of the prison blind;<br/> Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse<br/> Which has our nurses ever with itself.<br/></p>
			<p>Euripides is with us, Antiphon,<br/> Simonides, Agatho, and many other<br/> Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.<br/></p>
			<p>There some of thine own people may be seen,<br/> Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,<br/> And there Ismene mournful as of old.<br/></p>
			<p>There she is seen who pointed out Langia;<br/> There is Tiresias’ daughter, and there Thetis,<br/> And there Deidamia with her sisters.”<br/></p>
			<p>Silent already were the poets both,<br/> Attent once more in looking round about,<br/> From the ascent and from the walls released;<br/></p>
			<p>And four handmaidens of the day already<br/> Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth<br/> Was pointing upward still its burning horn,<br/></p>
			<p>What time my Guide: “I think that tow’rds the edge<br/> Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,<br/> Circling the mount as we are wont to do.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;<br/> And we resumed our way with less suspicion<br/> For the assenting of that worthy soul<br/></p>
			<p>They in advance went on, and I alone<br/> Behind them, and I listened to their speech,<br/> Which gave me lessons in the art of song.<br/></p>
			<p>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted<br/> A tree which midway in the road we found,<br/> With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.<br/></p>
			<p>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward<br/> From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;<br/> I think in order that no one might climb it.<br/></p>
			<p>On that side where our pathway was enclosed<br/> Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,<br/> And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.<br/></p>
			<p>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,<br/> And from among the foliage a voice<br/> Cried: “Of this food ye shall have scarcity.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then said: “More thoughtful Mary was of making<br/> The marriage feast complete and honourable,<br/> Than of her mouth which now for you responds;<br/></p>
			<p>And for their drink the ancient Roman women<br/> With water were content; and Daniel<br/> Disparaged food, and understanding won.<br/></p>
			<p>The primal age was beautiful as gold;<br/> Acorns it made with hunger savorous,<br/> And nectar every rivulet with thirst.<br/></p>
			<p>Honey and locusts were the aliments<br/> That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;<br/> Whence he is glorious, and so magnified<br/></p>
			<p>As by the Evangel is revealed to you.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIII</span></p>
			<p>The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes<br/> I riveted, as he is wont to do<br/> Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,<br/></p>
			<p>My more than Father said unto me: “Son,<br/> Come now; because the time that is ordained us<br/> More usefully should be apportioned out.”<br/></p>
			<p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps<br/> Unto the Sages, who were speaking so<br/> They made the going of no cost to me;<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,<br/> “Labia mea, Domine,” in fashion<br/> Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.<br/></p>
			<p>“O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?”<br/> Began I; and he answered: “Shades that go<br/> Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.”<br/></p>
			<p>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,<br/> Who, unknown people on the road o’ertaking,<br/> Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,<br/></p>
			<p>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion<br/> Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us<br/> A crowd of spirits silent and devout.<br/></p>
			<p>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br/> Pallid in face, and so emaciate<br/> That from the bones the skin did shape itself.<br/></p>
			<p>I do not think that so to merest rind<br/> Could Erisichthon have been withered up<br/> By famine, when most fear he had of it.<br/></p>
			<p>Thinking within myself I said: “Behold,<br/> This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,<br/> When Mary made a prey of her own son.”<br/></p>
			<p>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<br/> Whoever in the face of men reads ‘omo’<br/> Might well in these have recognised the ‘m.’<br/></p>
			<p>Who would believe the odour of an apple,<br/> Begetting longing, could consume them so,<br/> And that of water, without knowing how?<br/></p>
			<p>I still was wondering what so famished them,<br/> For the occasion not yet manifest<br/> Of their emaciation and sad squalor;<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br/> His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br/> Then cried aloud: “What grace to me is this?”<br/></p>
			<p>Never should I have known him by his look;<br/> But in his voice was evident to me<br/> That which his aspect had suppressed within it.<br/></p>
			<p>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br/> My recognition of his altered face,<br/> And I recalled the features of Forese.<br/></p>
			<p>“Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,”<br/> Entreated he, “which doth my skin discolour,<br/> Nor at default of flesh that I may have;<br/></p>
			<p>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br/> Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br/> Do not delay in speaking unto me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br/> Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,”<br/> I answered him, “beholding it so changed!<br/></p>
			<p>But tell me, for God’s sake, what thus denudes you?<br/> Make me not speak while I am marvelling,<br/> For ill speaks he who’s full of other longings.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “From the eternal council<br/> Falls power into the water and the tree<br/> Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.<br/></p>
			<p>All of this people who lamenting sing,<br/> For following beyond measure appetite<br/> In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.<br/></p>
			<p>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us<br/> The scent that issues from the apple-tree,<br/> And from the spray that sprinkles o’er the verdure;<br/></p>
			<p>And not a single time alone, this ground<br/> Encompassing, is refreshed our pain⁠—<br/> I say our pain, and ought to say our solace⁠—<br/></p>
			<p>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree<br/> Which led the Christ rejoicing to say ‘Eli,’<br/> When with his veins he liberated us.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him: “Forese, from that day<br/> When for a better life thou changedst worlds,<br/> Up to this time five years have not rolled round.<br/></p>
			<p>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee<br/> Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised<br/> Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,<br/></p>
			<p>How hast thou come up hitherward already?<br/> I thought to find thee down there underneath,<br/> Where time for time doth restitution make.”<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “Thus speedily has led me<br/> To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,<br/> My Nella with her overflowing tears;<br/></p>
			<p>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs<br/> Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,<br/> And from the other circles set me free.<br/></p>
			<p>So much more dear and pleasing is to God<br/> My little widow, whom so much I loved,<br/> As in good works she is the more alone;<br/></p>
			<p>For the Barbagia of Sardinia<br/> By far more modest in its women is<br/> Than the Barbagia I have left her in.<br/></p>
			<p>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?<br/> A future time is in my sight already,<br/> To which this hour will not be very old,<br/></p>
			<p>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted<br/> To the unblushing womankind of Florence<br/> To go about displaying breast and paps.<br/></p>
			<p>What savages were e’er, what Saracens,<br/> Who stood in need, to make them covered go,<br/> Of spiritual or other discipline?<br/></p>
			<p>But if the shameless women were assured<br/> Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already<br/> Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;<br/></p>
			<p>For if my foresight here deceive me not,<br/> They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks<br/> Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.<br/></p>
			<p>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;<br/> See that not only I, but all these people<br/> Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence I to him: “If thou bring back to mind<br/> What thou with me hast been and I with thee,<br/> The present memory will be grievous still.<br/></p>
			<p>Out of that life he turned me back who goes<br/> In front of me, two days agone when round<br/> The sister of him yonder showed herself,”<br/></p>
			<p>And to the sun I pointed. “Through the deep<br/> Night of the truly dead has this one led me,<br/> With this true flesh, that follows after him.<br/></p>
			<p>Thence his encouragements have led me up,<br/> Ascending and still circling round the mount<br/> That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.<br/></p>
			<p>He says that he will bear me company,<br/> Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;<br/> There it behoves me to remain without him.<br/></p>
			<p>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,”<br/> And him I pointed at; “the other is<br/> That shade for whom just now shook every slope<br/></p>
			<p>Your realm, that from itself discharges him.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIV</span></p>
			<p>Nor speech the going, nor the going that<br/> Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,<br/> Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.<br/></p>
			<p>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,<br/> From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed<br/> Wonder at me, aware that I was living.<br/></p>
			<p>And I, continuing my colloquy,<br/> Said: “Peradventure he goes up more slowly<br/> Than he would do, for other people’s sake.<br/></p>
			<p>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;<br/> Tell me if any one of note I see<br/> Among this folk that gazes at me so.”<br/></p>
			<p>“My sister, who, ’twixt beautiful and good,<br/> I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing<br/> Already in her crown on high Olympus.”<br/></p>
			<p>So said he first, and then: “ ’Tis not forbidden<br/> To name each other here, so milked away<br/> Is our resemblance by our dieting.<br/></p>
			<p>This,” pointing with his finger, “is Buonagiunta,<br/> Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face<br/> Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,<br/></p>
			<p>Has held the holy Church within his arms;<br/> From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br/> Bolsena’s eels and the Vernaccia wine.”<br/></p>
			<p>He named me many others one by one;<br/> And all contented seemed at being named,<br/> So that for this I saw not one dark look.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br/> Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br/> Who with his crook had pastured many people.<br/></p>
			<p>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br/> Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br/> And he was one who ne’er felt satisfied.<br/></p>
			<p>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br/> One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br/> Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.<br/></p>
			<p>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br/> From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br/> Of justice, that doth macerate them so.<br/></p>
			<p>“O soul,” I said, “that seemest so desirous<br/> To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br/> And with thy speech appease thyself and me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,”<br/> Began he, “who to thee shall pleasant make<br/> My city, howsoever men may blame it.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br/> If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br/> True things hereafter will declare it to thee.<br/></p>
			<p>But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/> Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/> ‘Ladies, that have intelligence of love?’ ”<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him: “One am I, who, whenever<br/> Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/> Which he within me dictates, singing go.”<br/></p>
			<p>“O brother, now I see,” he said, “the knot<br/> Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/> Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.<br/></p>
			<p>I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/> Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/> Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;<br/></p>
			<p>And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/> No difference sees from one style to another;”<br/> And as if satisfied, he held his peace.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as the birds, that winter tow’rds the Nile,<br/> Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/> Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;<br/></p>
			<p>In such wise all the people who were there,<br/> Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/> Both by their leanness and their wishes light.<br/></p>
			<p>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/> Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/> Until he vents the panting of his chest;<br/></p>
			<p>So did Forese let the holy flock<br/> Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/> “When will it be that I again shall see thee?”<br/></p>
			<p>“How long,” I answered, “I may live, I know not;<br/> Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/> But I shall sooner in desire arrive;<br/></p>
			<p>Because the place where I was set to live<br/> From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/> And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Now go,” he said, “for him most guilty of it<br/> At a beast’s tail behold I dragged along<br/> Towards the valley where is no repentance.<br/></p>
			<p>Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/> Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/> And leaves the body vilely mutilated.<br/></p>
			<p>Not long those wheels shall turn,” and he uplifted<br/> His eyes to heaven, “ere shall be clear to thee<br/> That which my speech no farther can declare.<br/></p>
			<p>Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/> Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/> By coming onward thus abreast with thee.”<br/></p>
			<p>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/> A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/> And seeks the honour of the first encounter,<br/></p>
			<p>So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/> And on the road remained I with those two,<br/> Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<br/></p>
			<p>And when before us he had gone so far<br/> Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/> As was my understanding to his words,<br/></p>
			<p>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/> Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/> From having but just then turned thitherward.<br/></p>
			<p>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/> And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/> Like little children eager and deluded,<br/></p>
			<p>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/> But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/> Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.<br/></p>
			<p>Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/> And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/> Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.<br/></p>
			<p>“Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/> The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/> And out of that one has this tree been raised.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/> Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/> Went crowding forward on the side that rises.<br/></p>
			<p>“Be mindful,” said he, “of the accursed ones<br/> Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/> Combated Theseus with their double breasts;<br/></p>
			<p>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/> Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/> When he tow’rds Midian the hills descended.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/> On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/> Followed forsooth by miserable gains;<br/></p>
			<p>Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/> A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/> In contemplation, each without a word.<br/></p>
			<p>“What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?”<br/> Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/> As terrified and timid beasts are wont.<br/></p>
			<p>I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/> And never in a furnace was there seen<br/> Metals or glass so lucent and so red<br/></p>
			<p>As one I saw who said: “If it may please you<br/> To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/> This way goes he who goeth after peace.”<br/></p>
			<p>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/> So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/> Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.<br/></p>
			<p>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/> The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/> Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,<br/></p>
			<p>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/> My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/> That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;<br/></p>
			<p>And heard it said: “Blessed are they whom grace<br/> So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/> Excites not in their breasts too great desire,<br/></p>
			<p>Hungering at all times so far as is just.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXV</span></p>
			<p>Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br/> Because the sun had his meridian circle<br/> To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;<br/></p>
			<p>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,<br/> But goes his way, whate’er to him appear,<br/> If of necessity the sting transfix him,<br/></p>
			<p>In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br/> Taking the stairway, one before the other,<br/> Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.<br/></p>
			<p>And as the little stork that lifts its wing<br/> With a desire to fly, and does not venture<br/> To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,<br/></p>
			<p>Even such was I, with the desire of asking<br/> Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming<br/> He makes who doth address himself to speak.<br/></p>
			<p>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,<br/> My father sweet forbore, but said: “Let fly<br/> The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.”<br/></p>
			<p>With confidence I opened then my mouth,<br/> And I began: “How can one meagre grow<br/> There where the need of nutriment applies not?”<br/></p>
			<p>“If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<br/> Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,<br/> This would not,” said he, “be to thee so sour;<br/></p>
			<p>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion<br/> Trembles within a mirror your own image;<br/> That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.<br/></p>
			<p>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish<br/> Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray<br/> He now will be the healer of thy wounds.”<br/></p>
			<p>“If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,”<br/> Responded Statius, “where thou present art,<br/> Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then he began: “Son, if these words of mine<br/> Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,<br/> They’ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.<br/></p>
			<p>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up<br/> Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth<br/> Like food that from the table thou removest,<br/></p>
			<p>Takes in the heart for all the human members<br/> Virtue informative, as being that<br/> Which to be changed to them goes through the veins<br/></p>
			<p>Again digest, descends it where ’tis better<br/> Silent to be than say; and then drops thence<br/> Upon another’s blood in natural vase.<br/></p>
			<p>There one together with the other mingles,<br/> One to be passive meant, the other active<br/> By reason of the perfect place it springs from;<br/></p>
			<p>And being conjoined, begins to operate,<br/> Coagulating first, then vivifying<br/> What for its matter it had made consistent.<br/></p>
			<p>The active virtue, being made a soul<br/> As of a plant, (in so far different,<br/> This on the way is, that arrived already,)<br/></p>
			<p>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<br/> Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes<br/> To organize the powers whose seed it is.<br/></p>
			<p>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself<br/> The virtue from the generator’s heart,<br/> Where nature is intent on all the members.<br/></p>
			<p>But how from animal it man becomes<br/> Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point<br/> Which made a wiser man than thou once err<br/></p>
			<p>So far, that in his doctrine separate<br/> He made the soul from possible intellect,<br/> For he no organ saw by this assumed.<br/></p>
			<p>Open thy breast unto the truth that’s coming,<br/> And know that, just as soon as in the foetus<br/> The articulation of the brain is perfect,<br/></p>
			<p>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<br/> At so great art of nature, and inspires<br/> A spirit new with virtue all replete,<br/></p>
			<p>Which what it finds there active doth attract<br/> Into its substance, and becomes one soul,<br/> Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.<br/></p>
			<p>And that thou less may wonder at my word,<br/> Behold the sun’s heat, which becometh wine,<br/> Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.<br/></p>
			<p>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<br/> It separates from the flesh, and virtually<br/> Bears with itself the human and divine;<br/></p>
			<p>The other faculties are voiceless all;<br/> The memory, the intelligence, and the will<br/> In action far more vigorous than before.<br/></p>
			<p>Without a pause it falleth of itself<br/> In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<br/> There of its roads it first is cognizant.<br/></p>
			<p>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,<br/> The virtue informative rays round about,<br/> As, and as much as, in the living members.<br/></p>
			<p>And even as the air, when full of rain,<br/> By alien rays that are therein reflected,<br/> With divers colours shows itself adorned,<br/></p>
			<p>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself<br/> Into that form which doth impress upon it<br/> Virtually the soul that has stood still.<br/></p>
			<p>And then in manner of the little flame,<br/> Which followeth the fire where’er it shifts,<br/> After the spirit followeth its new form.<br/></p>
			<p>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,<br/> It is called shade; and thence it organizes<br/> Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.<br/></p>
			<p>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<br/> Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,<br/> That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.<br/></p>
			<p>According as impress us our desires<br/> And other affections, so the shade is shaped,<br/> And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.”<br/></p>
			<p>And now unto the last of all the circles<br/> Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,<br/> And were attentive to another care.<br/></p>
			<p>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,<br/> And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast<br/> That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.<br/></p>
			<p>Hence we must needs go on the open side,<br/> And one by one; and I did fear the fire<br/> On this side, and on that the falling down.<br/></p>
			<p>My Leader said: “Along this place one ought<br/> To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,<br/> Seeing that one so easily might err.”<br/></p>
			<p>“Summae Deus clementiae,” in the bosom<br/> Of the great burning chanted then I heard,<br/> Which made me no less eager to turn round;<br/></p>
			<p>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;<br/> Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs<br/> Apportioning my sight from time to time.<br/></p>
			<p>After the close which to that hymn is made,<br/> Aloud they shouted, “Virum non cognosco;”<br/> Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.<br/></p>
			<p>This also ended, cried they: “To the wood<br/> Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<br/> Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then to their song returned they; then the wives<br/> They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.<br/> As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.<br/></p>
			<p>And I believe that them this mode suffices,<br/> For all the time the fire is burning them;<br/> With such care is it needful, and such food,<br/></p>
			<p>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVI</span></p>
			<p>While on the brink thus one before the other<br/> We went upon our way, oft the good Master<br/> Said: “Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.”<br/></p>
			<p>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,<br/> That, raying out, already the whole west<br/> Changed from its azure aspect into white.<br/></p>
			<p>And with my shadow did I make the flame<br/> Appear more red; and even to such a sign<br/> Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.<br/></p>
			<p>This was the cause that gave them a beginning<br/> To speak of me; and to themselves began they<br/> To say: “That seems not a factitious body!”<br/></p>
			<p>Then towards me, as far as they could come,<br/> Came certain of them, always with regard<br/> Not to step forth where they would not be burned.<br/></p>
			<p>“O thou who goest, not from being slower<br/> But reverent perhaps, behind the others,<br/> Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.<br/></p>
			<p>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;<br/> For all of these have greater thirst for it<br/> Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.<br/></p>
			<p>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself<br/> A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not<br/> Entered as yet into the net of death.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight<br/> Should have revealed myself, were I not bent<br/> On other novelty that then appeared.<br/></p>
			<p>For through the middle of the burning road<br/> There came a people face to face with these,<br/> Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.<br/></p>
			<p>There see I hastening upon either side<br/> Each of the shades, and kissing one another<br/> Without a pause, content with brief salute.<br/></p>
			<p>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions<br/> Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another<br/> Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.<br/></p>
			<p>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,<br/> Or ever the first footstep passes onward,<br/> Each one endeavours to outcry the other;<br/></p>
			<p>The new-come people: “Sodom and Gomorrah!”<br/> The rest: “Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<br/> So that the bull unto her lust may run!”<br/></p>
			<p>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains<br/> Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,<br/> These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,<br/></p>
			<p>One folk is going, and the other coming,<br/> And weeping they return to their first songs,<br/> And to the cry that most befitteth them;<br/></p>
			<p>And close to me approached, even as before,<br/> The very same who had entreated me,<br/> Attent to listen in their countenance.<br/></p>
			<p>I, who their inclination twice had seen,<br/> Began: “O souls secure in the possession,<br/> Whene’er it may be, of a state of peace,<br/></p>
			<p>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained<br/> My members upon earth, but here are with me<br/> With their own blood and their articulations.<br/></p>
			<p>I go up here to be no longer blind;<br/> A Lady is above, who wins this grace,<br/> Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.<br/></p>
			<p>But as your greatest longing satisfied<br/> May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you<br/> Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,<br/></p>
			<p>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,<br/> Who are you, and what is that multitude<br/> Which goes upon its way behind your backs?”<br/></p>
			<p>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered<br/> The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,<br/> When rough and rustic to the town he goes,<br/></p>
			<p>Than every shade became in its appearance;<br/> But when they of their stupor were disburdened,<br/> Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,<br/></p>
			<p>“Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,”<br/> He recommenced who first had questioned us,<br/> “Experience freightest for a better life.<br/></p>
			<p>The folk that comes not with us have offended<br/> In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,<br/> Heard himself called in contumely, ‘Queen.’<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, ‘Sodom!’<br/> Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,<br/> And add unto their burning by their shame.<br/></p>
			<p>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;<br/> But because we observed not human law,<br/> Following like unto beasts our appetite,<br/></p>
			<p>In our opprobrium by us is read,<br/> When we part company, the name of her<br/> Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.<br/></p>
			<p>Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;<br/> Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,<br/> There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.<br/></p>
			<p>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;<br/> I’m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,<br/> Having repented ere the hour extreme.”<br/></p>
			<p>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus<br/> Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,<br/> Such I became, but rise not to such height,<br/></p>
			<p>The moment I heard name himself the father<br/> Of me and of my betters, who had ever<br/> Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;<br/></p>
			<p>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully<br/> For a long time I went, beholding him,<br/> Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.<br/></p>
			<p>When I was fed with looking, utterly<br/> Myself I offered ready for his service,<br/> With affirmation that compels belief.<br/></p>
			<p>And he to me: “Thou leavest footprints such<br/> In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,<br/> Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.<br/></p>
			<p>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,<br/> Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest<br/> In word and look that dear thou holdest me?”<br/></p>
			<p>And I to him: “Those dulcet lays of yours<br/> Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,<br/> Shall make for ever dear their very ink!”<br/></p>
			<p>“O brother,” said he, “he whom I point out,”<br/> And here he pointed at a spirit in front,<br/> “Was of the mother tongue a better smith.<br/></p>
			<p>Verses of love and proses of romance,<br/> He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,<br/> Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.<br/></p>
			<p>To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,<br/> And in this way establish their opinion,<br/> Ere art or reason has by them been heard.<br/></p>
			<p>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<br/> From cry to cry still giving him applause,<br/> Until the truth has conquered with most persons.<br/></p>
			<p>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege<br/> ’Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister<br/> Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,<br/></p>
			<p>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,<br/> So far as needful to us of this world,<br/> Where power of sinning is no longer ours.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,<br/> Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire<br/> As fish in water going to the bottom.<br/></p>
			<p>I moved a little tow’rds him pointed out,<br/> And said that to his name my own desire<br/> An honourable place was making ready.<br/></p>
			<p>He of his own free will began to say:<br/> ‘Tan m’ abellis vostre cortes deman,<br/> Que jeu nom’ puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;<br/></p>
			<p>Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;<br/> Consiros vei la passada folor,<br/> E vei jauzen lo jorn qu’ esper denan.<br/></p>
			<p>Ara vus prec per aquella valor,<br/> Que vus condus al som de la scalina,<br/> Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.’*<br/></p>
			<p>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</p>
			<p>* So pleases me your courteous demand,<br/> I cannot and I will not hide me from you.<br/> I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;<br/> Contrite I see the folly of the past,<br/> And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.<br/> Therefore do I implore you, by that power<br/> Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,<br/> Be mindful to assuage my suffering!<br/></p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVII</span></p>
			<p>As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br/> In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br/> (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,<br/></p>
			<p>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br/> So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br/> When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.<br/></p>
			<p>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br/> And chanted forth, “Beati mundo corde,”<br/> In voice by far more living than our own.<br/></p>
			<p>Then: “No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br/> If first the fire bite not; within it enter,<br/> And be not deaf unto the song beyond.”<br/></p>
			<p>When we were close beside him thus he said;<br/> Wherefore e’en such became I, when I heard him,<br/> As he is who is put into the grave.<br/></p>
			<p>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<br/> Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling<br/> The human bodies I had once seen burned.<br/></p>
			<p>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br/> And unto me Virgilius said: “My son,<br/> Here may indeed be torment, but not death.<br/></p>
			<p>Remember thee, remember! and if I<br/> On Geryon have safely guided thee,<br/> What shall I do now I am nearer God?<br/></p>
			<p>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full<br/> Millennium in the bosom of this flame,<br/> It could not make thee bald a single hair.<br/></p>
			<p>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,<br/> Draw near to it, and put it to the proof<br/> With thine own hands upon thy garment’s hem.<br/></p>
			<p>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,<br/> Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;”<br/> And I still motionless, and ’gainst my conscience!<br/></p>
			<p>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br/> Somewhat disturbed he said: “Now look thou, Son,<br/> ’Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.”<br/></p>
			<p>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br/> The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,<br/> What time the mulberry became vermilion,<br/></p>
			<p>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br/> I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br/> That in my memory evermore is welling.<br/></p>
			<p>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: “How now?<br/> Shall we stay on this side?” then smiled as one<br/> Does at a child who’s vanquished by an apple.<br/></p>
			<p>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,<br/> Beseeching Statius to come after me,<br/> Who a long way before divided us.<br/></p>
			<p>When I was in it, into molten glass<br/> I would have cast me to refresh myself,<br/> So without measure was the burning there!<br/></p>
			<p>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br/> Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,<br/> Saying: “Her eyes I seem to see already!”<br/></p>
			<p>A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br/> Directed us, and we, attent alone<br/> On that, came forth where the ascent began.<br/></p>
			<p>“Venite, benedicti Patris mei,”<br/> Sounded within a splendour, which was there<br/> Such it o’ercame me, and I could not look.<br/></p>
			<p>“The sun departs,” it added, “and night cometh;<br/> Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,<br/> So long as yet the west becomes not dark.”<br/></p>
			<p>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br/> In such a way that I cut off the rays<br/> Before me of the sun, that now was low.<br/></p>
			<p>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br/> Ere by the vanished shadow the sun’s setting<br/> Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.<br/></p>
			<p>And ere in all its parts immeasurable<br/> The horizon of one aspect had become,<br/> And Night her boundless dispensation held,<br/></p>
			<p>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br/> Because the nature of the mount took from us<br/> The power of climbing, more than the delight.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as in ruminating passive grow<br/> The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br/> Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,<br/></p>
			<p>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br/> Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br/> Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;<br/></p>
			<p>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br/> Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br/> Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,<br/></p>
			<p>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br/> I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br/> Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.<br/></p>
			<p>Little could there be seen of things without;<br/> But through that little I beheld the stars<br/> More luminous and larger than their wont.<br/></p>
			<p>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br/> Sleep seized upon me⁠—sleep, that oftentimes<br/> Before a deed is done has tidings of it.<br/></p>
			<p>It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br/> First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br/> Who with the fire of love seems always burning;<br/></p>
			<p>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br/> I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br/> Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:<br/></p>
			<p>“Know whosoever may my name demand<br/> That I am Leah, and go moving round<br/> My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.<br/></p>
			<p>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br/> But never does my sister Rachel leave<br/> Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.<br/></p>
			<p>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br/> As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br/> Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.”<br/></p>
			<p>And now before the antelucan splendours<br/> That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br/> As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,<br/></p>
			<p>The darkness fled away on every side,<br/> And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br/> Seeing already the great Masters risen.<br/></p>
			<p>“That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br/> The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br/> To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.”<br/></p>
			<p>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br/> As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br/> That could in pleasantness compare with these.<br/></p>
			<p>Such longing upon longing came upon me<br/> To be above, that at each step thereafter<br/> For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.<br/></p>
			<p>When underneath us was the stairway all<br/> Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,<br/> Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,<br/></p>
			<p>And said: “The temporal fire and the eternal,<br/> Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come<br/> Where of myself no farther I discern.<br/></p>
			<p>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;<br/> Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;<br/> Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.<br/></p>
			<p>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br/> Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br/> Which of itself alone this land produces.<br/></p>
			<p>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/> Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br/> Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.<br/></p>
			<p>Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br/> Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br/> And error were it not to do its bidding;<br/></p>
			<p>Thee o’er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVIII</span></p>
			<p>Eager already to search in and round<br/> The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,<br/> Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,<br/></p>
			<p>Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/> Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/> Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.<br/></p>
			<p>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/> Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br/> No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,<br/></p>
			<p>Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,<br/> Did all of them bow downward toward that side<br/> Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;<br/></p>
			<p>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/> So that the little birds upon their tops<br/> Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;<br/></p>
			<p>But with full ravishment the hours of prime,<br/> Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,<br/> That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,<br/></p>
			<p>Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on<br/> Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,<br/> When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.<br/></p>
			<p>Already my slow steps had carried me<br/> Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/> Could not perceive where I had entered it.<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/> Which tow’rd the left hand with its little waves<br/> Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.<br/></p>
			<p>All waters that on earth most limpid are<br/> Would seem to have within themselves some mixture<br/> Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,<br/></p>
			<p>Although it moves on with a brown, brown current<br/> Under the shade perpetual, that never<br/> Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.<br/></p>
			<p>With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed<br/> Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br/> The great variety of the fresh may.<br/></p>
			<p>And there appeared to me (even as appears<br/> Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/> Through very wonder every other thought)<br/></p>
			<p>A lady all alone, who went along<br/> Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/> With which her pathway was all painted over.<br/></p>
			<p>“Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/> Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/> Which the heart’s witnesses are wont to be,<br/></p>
			<p>May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/> Near to this river’s bank,” I said to her,<br/> “So much that I might hear what thou art singing.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou makest me remember where and what<br/> Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/> Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.”<br/></p>
			<p>As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/> And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/> And hardly puts one foot before the other,<br/></p>
			<p>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/> She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/> Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;<br/></p>
			<p>And my entreaties made to be content,<br/> So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/> Came unto me together with its meaning<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/> Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/> To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.<br/></p>
			<p>I do not think there shone so great a light<br/> Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/> By her own son, beyond his usual custom!<br/></p>
			<p>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/> Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br/> Which that high land produces without seed.<br/></p>
			<p>Apart three paces did the river make us;<br/> But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br/> (A curb still to all human arrogance,)<br/></p>
			<p>More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br/> For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br/> Than that from me, because it oped not then.<br/></p>
			<p>“Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,”<br/> Began she, “peradventure, in this place<br/> Elect to human nature for its nest,<br/></p>
			<p>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/> But the psalm ‘Delectasti’ giveth light<br/> Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.<br/></p>
			<p>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br/> Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/> To all thy questionings, as far as needful.”<br/></p>
			<p>“The water,” said I, “and the forest’s sound,<br/> Are combating within me my new faith<br/> In something which I heard opposed to this.”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence she: “I will relate how from its cause<br/> Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,<br/> And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.<br/></p>
			<p>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,<br/> Created man good, and this goodly place<br/> Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.<br/></p>
			<p>By his default short while he sojourned here;<br/> By his default to weeping and to toil<br/> He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.<br/></p>
			<p>That the disturbance which below is made<br/> By exhalations of the land and water,<br/> (Which far as may be follow after heat,)<br/></p>
			<p>Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br/> This mount ascended tow’rds the heaven so high,<br/> And is exempt, from there where it is locked.<br/></p>
			<p>Now since the universal atmosphere<br/> Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br/> Unless the circle is broken on some side,<br/></p>
			<p>Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br/> In living ether, doth this motion strike<br/> And make the forest sound, for it is dense;<br/></p>
			<p>And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br/> That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br/> And this, revolving, scatters it around;<br/></p>
			<p>And yonder earth, according as ’tis worthy<br/> In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br/> Of divers qualities the divers trees;<br/></p>
			<p>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br/> This being heard, whenever any plant<br/> Without seed manifest there taketh root.<br/></p>
			<p>And thou must know, this holy table-land<br/> In which thou art is full of every seed,<br/> And fruit has in it never gathered there.<br/></p>
			<p>The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br/> Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br/> Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;<br/></p>
			<p>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br/> Which by the will of God as much regains<br/> As it discharges, open on two sides.<br/></p>
			<p>Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br/> Which takes away all memory of sin;<br/> On that, of every good deed done restores it.<br/></p>
			<p>Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br/> Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br/> If first on either side it be not tasted.<br/></p>
			<p>This every other savour doth transcend;<br/> And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br/> Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,<br/></p>
			<p>I’ll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br/> Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br/> If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.<br/></p>
			<p>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br/> The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br/> Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.<br/></p>
			<p>Here was the human race in innocence;<br/> Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br/> This is the nectar of which each one speaks.”<br/></p>
			<p>Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br/> Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br/> They had been listening to these closing words;<br/></p>
			<p>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIX</span></p>
			<p>Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br/> She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br/> “Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.”<br/></p>
			<p>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br/> Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/> One to avoid and one to see the sun,<br/></p>
			<p>She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/> Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/> Her little steps with little steps attending.<br/></p>
			<p>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br/> When equally the margins gave a turn,<br/> In such a way, that to the East I faced.<br/></p>
			<p>Nor even thus our way continued far<br/> Before the lady wholly turned herself<br/> Unto me, saying, “Brother, look and listen!”<br/></p>
			<p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br/> On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br/> Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.<br/></p>
			<p>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br/> And that continuing brightened more and more,<br/> Within my thought I said, “What thing is this?”<br/></p>
			<p>And a delicious melody there ran<br/> Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br/> Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;<br/></p>
			<p>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/> The woman only, and but just created,<br/> Could not endure to stay ’neath any veil;<br/></p>
			<p>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br/> I sooner should have tasted those delights<br/> Ineffable, and for a longer time.<br/></p>
			<p>While ‘mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br/> Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br/> And still solicitous of more delights,<br/></p>
			<p>In front of us like an enkindled fire<br/> Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br/> And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.<br/></p>
			<p>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br/> Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br/> The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!<br/></p>
			<p>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br/> And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br/> To put in verse things difficult to think.<br/></p>
			<p>A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br/> In semblance the long space still intervening<br/> Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;<br/></p>
			<p>But when I had approached so near to them<br/> The common object, which the sense deceives,<br/> Lost not by distance any of its marks,<br/></p>
			<p>The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br/> Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br/> And in the voices of the song “Hosanna!”<br/></p>
			<p>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br/> Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br/> Of midnight, at the middle of her month.<br/></p>
			<p>I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br/> To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br/> With visage no less full of wonderment.<br/></p>
			<p>Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br/> Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br/> They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.<br/></p>
			<p>The lady chid me: “Why dost thou burn only<br/> So with affection for the living lights,<br/> And dost not look at what comes after them?”<br/></p>
			<p>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br/> Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br/> And such a whiteness never was on earth.<br/></p>
			<p>The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br/> And back to me reflected my left side,<br/> E’en as a mirror, if I looked therein.<br/></p>
			<p>When I upon my margin had such post<br/> That nothing but the stream divided us,<br/> Better to see I gave my steps repose;<br/></p>
			<p>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,<br/> Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,<br/> And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,<br/></p>
			<p>So that it overhead remained distinct<br/> With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br/> Whence the sun’s bow is made, and Delia’s girdle.<br/></p>
			<p>These standards to the rearward longer were<br/> Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br/> Ten paces were the outermost apart.<br/></p>
			<p>Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br/> The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br/> Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.<br/></p>
			<p>They all of them were singing: “Blessed thou<br/> Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed<br/> For evermore shall be thy loveliness.”<br/></p>
			<p>After the flowers and other tender grasses<br/> In front of me upon the other margin<br/> Were disencumbered of that race elect,<br/></p>
			<p>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br/> There came close after them four animals,<br/> Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.<br/></p>
			<p>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br/> The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus<br/> If they were living would be such as these.<br/></p>
			<p>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste<br/> My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,<br/> That I in this cannot be prodigal.<br/></p>
			<p>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<br/> As he beheld them from the region cold<br/> Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;<br/></p>
			<p>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,<br/> Such were they here; saving that in their plumage<br/> John is with me, and differeth from him.<br/></p>
			<p>The interval between these four contained<br/> A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<br/> Which by a Griffin’s neck came drawn along;<br/></p>
			<p>And upward he extended both his wings<br/> Between the middle list and three and three,<br/> So that he injured none by cleaving it.<br/></p>
			<p>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br/> His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,<br/> And white the others with vermilion mingled.<br/></p>
			<p>Not only Rome with no such splendid car<br/> E’er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,<br/> But poor to it that of the Sun would be⁠—<br/></p>
			<p>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up<br/> At the importunate orison of Earth,<br/> When Jove was so mysteriously just.<br/></p>
			<p>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<br/> Came onward dancing; one so very red<br/> That in the fire she hardly had been noted.<br/></p>
			<p>The second was as if her flesh and bones<br/> Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br/> The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.<br/></p>
			<p>And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br/> Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/> The others took their step, or slow or swift.<br/></p>
			<p>Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/> Vested in purple, following the measure<br/> Of one of them with three eyes m her head.<br/></p>
			<p>In rear of all the group here treated of<br/> Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br/> But like in gait, each dignified and grave.<br/></p>
			<p>One showed himself as one of the disciples<br/> Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature<br/> Made for the animals she holds most dear;<br/></p>
			<p>Contrary care the other manifested,<br/> With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<br/> Terror to me on this side of the river.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<br/> And behind all an aged man alone<br/> Walking in sleep with countenance acute.<br/></p>
			<p>And like the foremost company these seven<br/> Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br/> No garland round about the head they wore,<br/></p>
			<p>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br/> At little distance would the sight have sworn<br/> That all were in a flame above their brows.<br/></p>
			<p>And when the car was opposite to me<br/> Thunder was heard; and all that folk august<br/> Seemed to have further progress interdicted,<br/></p>
			<p>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXX</span></p>
			<p>When the Septentrion of the highest heaven<br/> (Which never either setting knew or rising,<br/> Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,<br/></p>
			<p>And which made every one therein aware<br/> Of his own duty, as the lower makes<br/> Whoever turns the helm to come to port)<br/></p>
			<p>Motionless halted, the veracious people,<br/> That came at first between it and the Griffin,<br/> Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.<br/></p>
			<p>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,<br/> Singing, “Veni, sponsa, de Libano”<br/> Shouted three times, and all the others after.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as the Blessed at the final summons<br/> Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,<br/> Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,<br/></p>
			<p>So upon that celestial chariot<br/> A hundred rose ‘ad vocem tanti senis,’<br/> Ministers and messengers of life eternal.<br/></p>
			<p>They all were saying, “Benedictus qui venis,”<br/> And, scattering flowers above and round about,<br/> “Manibus o date lilia plenis.”<br/></p>
			<p>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,<br/> The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,<br/> And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;<br/></p>
			<p>And the sun’s face, uprising, overshadowed<br/> So that by tempering influence of vapours<br/> For a long interval the eye sustained it;<br/></p>
			<p>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers<br/> Which from those hands angelical ascended,<br/> And downward fell again inside and out,<br/></p>
			<p>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct<br/> Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<br/> Vested in colour of the living flame.<br/></p>
			<p>And my own spirit, that already now<br/> So long a time had been, that in her presence<br/> Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,<br/></p>
			<p>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,<br/> Through occult virtue that from her proceeded<br/> Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as on my vision smote the power<br/> Sublime, that had already pierced me through<br/> Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,<br/></p>
			<p>To the left hand I turned with that reliance<br/> With which the little child runs to his mother,<br/> When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,<br/></p>
			<p>To say unto Virgilius: “Not a drachm<br/> Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;<br/> I know the traces of the ancient flame.”<br/></p>
			<p>But us Virgilius of himself deprived<br/> Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,<br/> Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:<br/></p>
			<p>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<br/> Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,<br/> That weeping they should not again be darkened.<br/></p>
			<p>“Dante, because Virgilius has departed<br/> Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;<br/> For by another sword thou need’st must weep.”<br/></p>
			<p>E’en as an admiral, who on poop and prow<br/> Comes to behold the people that are working<br/> In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,<br/></p>
			<p>Upon the left hand border of the car,<br/> When at the sound I turned of my own name,<br/> Which of necessity is here recorded,<br/></p>
			<p>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared<br/> Veiled underneath the angelic festival,<br/> Direct her eyes to me across the river.<br/></p>
			<p>Although the veil, that from her head descended,<br/> Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,<br/> Did not permit her to appear distinctly,<br/></p>
			<p>In attitude still royally majestic<br/> Continued she, like unto one who speaks,<br/> And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:<br/></p>
			<p>“Look at me well; in sooth I’m Beatrice!<br/> How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?<br/> Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”<br/></p>
			<p>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,<br/> But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,<br/> So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.<br/></p>
			<p>As to the son the mother seems superb,<br/> So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter<br/> Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.<br/></p>
			<p>Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/> Suddenly, “In te, Domine, speravi:”<br/> But beyond ‘pedes meos’ did not pass.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/> Upon the back of Italy congeals,<br/> Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,<br/></p>
			<p>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself<br/> Whene’er the land that loses shadow breathes,<br/> So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;<br/></p>
			<p>E’en thus was I without a tear or sigh,<br/> Before the song of those who sing for ever<br/> After the music of the eternal spheres.<br/></p>
			<p>But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/> Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/> “O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?”<br/></p>
			<p>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/> To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br/> Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.<br/></p>
			<p>She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/> Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br/> Thus her discourse directed afterwards:<br/></p>
			<p>“Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br/> So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br/> One step the ages make upon their path;<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br/> That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br/> So that the sin and dole be of one measure.<br/></p>
			<p>Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/> That destine every seed unto some end,<br/> According as the stars are in conjunction,<br/></p>
			<p>But by the largess of celestial graces,<br/> Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/> That near to them our sight approaches not,<br/></p>
			<p>Such had this man become in his new life<br/> Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/> Would have made admirable proof in him;<br/></p>
			<p>But so much more malignant and more savage<br/> Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/> The more good earthly vigour it possesses.<br/></p>
			<p>Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/> Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/> I led him with me turned in the right way.<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as ever of my second age<br/> I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/> Himself from me he took and gave to others.<br/></p>
			<p>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br/> And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/> I was to him less dear and less delightful;<br/></p>
			<p>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/> Pursuing the false images of good,<br/> That never any promises fulfil;<br/></p>
			<p>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/> By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/> I called him back, so little did he heed them.<br/></p>
			<p>So low he fell, that all appliances<br/> For his salvation were already short,<br/> Save showing him the people of perdition.<br/></p>
			<p>For this I visited the gates of death,<br/> And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/> My intercessions were with weeping borne.<br/></p>
			<p>God’s lofty fiat would be violated,<br/> If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/> Should tasted be, withouten any scot<br/></p>
			<p>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.”</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXI</span></p>
			<p>“O thou who art beyond the sacred river,”<br/> Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/> That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,<br/></p>
			<p>She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/> “Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/> Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.”<br/></p>
			<p>My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/> That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/> Than by its organs it was set at large.<br/></p>
			<p>Awhile she waited; then she said: “What thinkest?<br/> Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/> In thee not yet are by the waters injured.”<br/></p>
			<p>Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/> Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/> Was needful to the understanding of it.<br/></p>
			<p>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when ’tis discharged<br/> Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/> And with less force the arrow hits the mark,<br/></p>
			<p>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/> Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/> And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.<br/></p>
			<p>Whence she to me: “In those desires of mine<br/> Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/> Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,<br/></p>
			<p>What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/> Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/> Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?<br/></p>
			<p>And what allurements or what vantages<br/> Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/> That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?”<br/></p>
			<p>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/> Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/> And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.<br/></p>
			<p>Weeping I said: “The things that present were<br/> With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/> Soon as your countenance concealed itself.”<br/></p>
			<p>And she: “Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/> What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/> Would be thy fault, by such a Judge ’tis known.<br/></p>
			<p>But when from one’s own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/> The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/> Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<br/></p>
			<p>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/> For thy transgression, and another time<br/> Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,<br/></p>
			<p>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/> So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/> My buried flesh should have directed thee.<br/></p>
			<p>Never to thee presented art or nature<br/> Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/> I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.<br/></p>
			<p>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/> By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/> Should then have drawn thee into its desire?<br/></p>
			<p>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/> Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/> To follow me, who was no longer such.<br/></p>
			<p>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/> To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br/> Or other vanity of such brief use.<br/></p>
			<p>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/> But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/> In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.”<br/></p>
			<p>Even as children silent in their shame<br/> Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/> And conscious of their fault, and penitent;<br/></p>
			<p>So was I standing; and she said: “If thou<br/> In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/> And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.”<br/></p>
			<p>With less resistance is a robust holm<br/> Uprooted, either by a native wind<br/> Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,<br/></p>
			<p>Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br/> And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/> Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.<br/></p>
			<p>And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/> Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/> Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;<br/></p>
			<p>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/> Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/> That is one person only in two natures.<br/></p>
			<p>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/> She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/> To excel, than others here, when she was here.<br/></p>
			<p>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/> That of all other things the one which turned me<br/> Most to its love became the most my foe.<br/></p>
			<p>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/> O’erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br/> She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.<br/></p>
			<p>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br/> The lady I had found alone, above me<br/> I saw, and she was saying, “Hold me, hold me.”<br/></p>
			<p>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br/> And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br/> Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.<br/></p>
			<p>When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br/> “Asperges me,” I heard so sweetly sung,<br/> Remember it I cannot, much less write it.<br/></p>
			<p>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/> Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br/> Where I was forced to swallow of the water.<br/></p>
			<p>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/> Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/> And each one with her arm did cover me.<br/></p>
			<p>‘We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br/> Ere Beatrice descended to the world,<br/> We as her handmaids were appointed her.<br/></p>
			<p>We’ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant<br/> Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br/> The three beyond, who more profoundly look.’<br/></p>
			<p>Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/> Unto the Griffin’s breast they led me with them,<br/> Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.<br/></p>
			<p>“See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,” they said;<br/> “Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br/> Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.”<br/></p>
			<p>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/> Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br/> That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.<br/></p>
			<p>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br/> Within them was the twofold monster shining,<br/> Now with the one, now with the other nature.<br/></p>
			<p>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,<br/> When I beheld the thing itself stand still,<br/> And in its image it transformed itself.<br/></p>
			<p>While with amazement filled and jubilant,<br/> My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br/> It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,<br/></p>
			<p>Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br/> In bearing, did the other three advance,<br/> Singing to their angelic saraband.<br/></p>
			<p>“Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,”<br/> Such was their song, “unto thy faithful one,<br/> Who has to see thee ta’en so many steps.<br/></p>
			<p>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil<br/> Thy face to him, so that he may discern<br/> The second beauty which thou dost conceal.”<br/></p>
			<p>O splendour of the living light eternal!<br/> Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus<br/> Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,<br/></p>
			<p>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered<br/> Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,<br/> Where the harmonious heaven o’ershadowed thee,<br/></p>
			<p>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span></p>
			<p>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes<br/> In satisfying their decennial thirst,<br/> That all my other senses were extinct,<br/></p>
			<p>And upon this side and on that they had<br/> Walls of indifference, so the holy smile<br/> Drew them unto itself with the old net<br/></p>
			<p>When forcibly my sight was turned away<br/> Towards my left hand by those goddesses,<br/> Because I heard from them a “Too intently!”<br/></p>
			<p>And that condition of the sight which is<br/> In eyes but lately smitten by the sun<br/> Bereft me of my vision some short while;<br/></p>
			<p>But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,<br/> I say the less in reference to the greater<br/> Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,<br/></p>
			<p>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about<br/> The glorious host returning with the sun<br/> And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.<br/></p>
			<p>As underneath its shields, to save itself,<br/> A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,<br/> Before the whole thereof can change its front,<br/></p>
			<p>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom<br/> Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us<br/> Before the chariot had turned its pole.<br/></p>
			<p>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,<br/> And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,<br/> But so that not a feather of him fluttered.<br/></p>
			<p>The lady fair who drew me through the ford<br/> Followed with Statius and myself the wheel<br/> Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.<br/></p>
			<p>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant<br/> By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,<br/> Angelic music made our steps keep time.<br/></p>
			<p>Perchance as great a space had in three flights<br/> An arrow loosened from the string o’erpassed,<br/> As we had moved when Beatrice descended.<br/></p>
			<p>I heard them murmur altogether, “Adam!”<br/> Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br/> Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.<br/></p>
			<p>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br/> As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<br/> Among their forests marvelled at for height.<br/></p>
			<p>“Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<br/> Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,<br/> Since appetite by this was turned to evil.”<br/></p>
			<p>After this fashion round the tree robust<br/> The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br/> “Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.”<br/></p>
			<p>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br/> He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br/> And what was of it unto it left bound.<br/></p>
			<p>In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br/> Falls the great light, with that together mingled<br/> Which after the celestial Lasca shines)<br/></p>
			<p>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,<br/> Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun<br/> Harness his steeds beneath another star:<br/></p>
			<p>Less than of rose and more than violet<br/> A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree<br/> That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.<br/></p>
			<p>I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br/> The hymn which afterward that people sang,<br/> Nor did I bear the melody throughout.<br/></p>
			<p>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep<br/> Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<br/> Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,<br/></p>
			<p>Even as a painter who from model paints<br/> I would portray how I was lulled asleep;<br/> He may, who well can picture drowsihood.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,<br/> And say a splendour rent from me the veil<br/> Of slumber, and a calling: “Rise, what dost thou?”<br/></p>
			<p>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br/> Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br/> And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,<br/></p>
			<p>Peter and John and James conducted were,<br/> And, overcome, recovered at the word<br/> By which still greater slumbers have been broken,<br/></p>
			<p>And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/> Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/> And the apparel of their Master changed;<br/></p>
			<p>So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/> Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/> Aforetime of my steps beside the river,<br/></p>
			<p>And all in doubt I said, “Where’s Beatrice?”<br/> And she: “Behold her seated underneath<br/> The leafage new, upon the root of it.<br/></p>
			<p>Behold the company that circles her;<br/> The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/> With more melodious song, and more profound.”<br/></p>
			<p>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/> Because already in my sight was she<br/> Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.<br/></p>
			<p>Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/> Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/> Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.<br/></p>
			<p>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/> The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/> Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.<br/></p>
			<p>“Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/> And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br/> A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.<br/></p>
			<p>Therefore, for that world’s good which liveth ill,<br/> Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/> Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.”<br/></p>
			<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/> Of her commandments all devoted was,<br/> My mind and eyes directed where she willed.<br/></p>
			<p>Never descended with so swift a motion<br/> Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/> From out the region which is most remote,<br/></p>
			<p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/> Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/> As well as blossoms and the foliage new,<br/></p>
			<p>And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/> Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/> Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.<br/></p>
			<p>Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/> Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/> That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.<br/></p>
			<p>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/> My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/> As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.<br/></p>
			<p>Then by the way that it before had come,<br/> Into the chariot’s chest I saw the Eagle<br/> Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<br/></p>
			<p>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/> A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/> “My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!”<br/></p>
			<p>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/> Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/> Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,<br/></p>
			<p>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/> Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/> Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.<br/></p>
			<p>That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/> A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/> Perhaps with pure intention and benign,<br/></p>
			<p>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/> The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/> A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.<br/></p>
			<p>Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/> Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/> Three on the pole and one at either corner.<br/></p>
			<p>The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/> Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/> A monster such had never yet been seen!<br/></p>
			<p>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/> Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/> A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<br/></p>
			<p>And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/> Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/> And ever and anon they kissed each other.<br/></p>
			<p>But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/> Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/> Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<br/></p>
			<p>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/> He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/> Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<br/></p>
			<p>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>
			<p>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIII</span></p>
			<p>“Deus venerunt gentes,” alternating<br/> Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br/> The maidens in the midst of tears began;<br/></p>
			<p>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br/> Listened to them with such a countenance,<br/> That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.<br/></p>
			<p>But when the other virgins place had given<br/> For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br/> With colour as of fire, she made response:<br/></p>
			<p>“ ‘Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br/> Et iterum,’ my sisters predilect,<br/> ‘Modicum, et vos videbitis me.’ ”<br/></p>
			<p>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br/> And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br/> Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.<br/></p>
			<p>So she moved onward; and I do not think<br/> That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br/> When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,<br/></p>
			<p>And with a tranquil aspect, “Come more quickly,”<br/> To me she said, “that, if I speak with thee,<br/> To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.”<br/></p>
			<p>As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/> She said to me: “Why, brother, dost thou not<br/> Venture to question now, in coming with me?”<br/></p>
			<p>As unto those who are too reverential,<br/> Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/> Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,<br/></p>
			<p>It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/> Began I: “My necessity, Madonna,<br/> You know, and that which thereunto is good.”<br/></p>
			<p>And she to me: “Of fear and bashfulness<br/> Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/> So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.<br/></p>
			<p>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/> Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br/> Think that God’s vengeance does not fear a sop.<br/></p>
			<p>Without an heir shall not for ever be<br/> The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br/> Whence it became a monster, then a prey;<br/></p>
			<p>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br/> The stars already near to bring the time,<br/> From every hindrance safe, and every bar,<br/></p>
			<p>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br/> One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br/> And that same giant who is sinning with her.<br/></p>
			<p>And peradventure my dark utterance,<br/> Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br/> Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;<br/></p>
			<p>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br/> Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br/> Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.<br/></p>
			<p>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br/> These words, so teach them unto those who live<br/> That life which is a running unto death;<br/></p>
			<p>And bear in mind, whene’er thou writest them,<br/> Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br/> That twice already has been pillaged here.<br/></p>
			<p>Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br/> With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br/> Who made it holy for his use alone.<br/></p>
			<p>For biting that, in pain and in desire<br/> Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br/> Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.<br/></p>
			<p>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br/> For special reason so pre-eminent<br/> In height, and so inverted in its summit.<br/></p>
			<p>And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br/> Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br/> And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,<br/></p>
			<p>Thou by so many circumstances only<br/> The justice of the interdict of God<br/> Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.<br/></p>
			<p>But since I see thee in thine intellect<br/> Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br/> So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,<br/></p>
			<p>I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br/> Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br/> That cinct with palm the pilgrim’s staff is borne.”<br/></p>
			<p>And I: “As by a signet is the wax<br/> Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br/> My brain is now imprinted by yourself.<br/></p>
			<p>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br/> Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br/> The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?”<br/></p>
			<p>“That thou mayst recognize,” she said, “the school<br/> Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br/> Its doctrine follows after my discourse,<br/></p>
			<p>And mayst behold your path from the divine<br/> Distant as far as separated is<br/> From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.”<br/></p>
			<p>Whence her I answered: “I do not remember<br/> That ever I estranged myself from you,<br/> Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.”<br/></p>
			<p>“And if thou art not able to remember,”<br/> Smiling she answered, “recollect thee now<br/> That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;<br/></p>
			<p>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br/> Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br/> Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.<br/></p>
			<p>Truly from this time forward shall my words<br/> Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br/> To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.”<br/></p>
			<p>And more coruscant and with slower steps<br/> The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br/> Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there<br/></p>
			<p>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br/> Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br/> If something new he find upon his way)<br/></p>
			<p>The ladies seven at a dark shadow’s edge,<br/> Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br/> The Alp upon its frigid border wears.<br/></p>
			<p>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br/> Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br/> And slowly part, like friends, from one another.<br/></p>
			<p>“O light, O glory of the human race!<br/> What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br/> From out one source, and from itself withdraws?”<br/></p>
			<p>For such a prayer, ’twas said unto me, “Pray<br/> Matilda that she tell thee;” and here answered,<br/> As one does who doth free himself from blame,<br/></p>
			<p>The beautiful lady: “This and other things<br/> Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br/> The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.”<br/></p>
			<p>And Beatrice: “Perhaps a greater care,<br/> Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br/> Has made the vision of his mind obscure.<br/></p>
			<p>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br/> Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br/> Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.”<br/></p>
			<p>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br/> But makes its own will of another’s will<br/> As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,<br/></p>
			<p>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br/> The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br/> Said, in her womanly manner, “Come with him.”<br/></p>
			<p>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br/> For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br/> Of the sweet draught that ne’er would satiate me;<br/></p>
			<p>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br/> Made ready for this second canticle,<br/> The curb of art no farther lets me go.<br/></p>
			<p>From the most holy water I returned<br/> Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br/> That are renewed with a new foliage,<br/></p>
			<p>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p>
